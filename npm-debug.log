35 silly resolved     readme: 'Spark CLI\n==========\n\nThe Spark CLI is a powerful tool for interacting with your cores and the Spark Cloud.  The CLI uses [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and can run on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux fairly easily.  It\'s also [open source](https://github.com/spark/spark-cli) so you can edit and change it, and even send in your changes as [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) if you want to share!\n\nInstalling\n=======\n\n  First, make sure you have [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed!  \n\n  Next, open a command prompt or terminal, and install by typing:\n\n```sh \n$ npm install -g spark-cli\n$ spark cloud login\n```\n\n  *Note!*  If you have problems running this, make sure you using Terminal / the Command Prompt as an Administator, or try using `sudo`\n  \n```sh\n$ sudo npm install -g spark-cli\n```\n\n\nInstall (advanced)\n---------------------------\n\nTo use the local flash and key features you\'ll need to install [dfu-util](http://dfu-util.sourceforge.net/) (note the normal main page http://dfu-util.gnumonks.org/ is still down), and [openssl](http://www.openssl.org/).  They are freely available and open-source, and there are installers and binaries for most major platforms as well.  \n\nHere are some great tutorials on the community for full installs:\n\n[Installing on Ubuntu](https://community.spark.io/t/how-to-install-spark-cli-on-ubuntu-12-04/3474)\n\n[Installing on Windows](https://community.spark.io/t/tutorial-spark-cli-on-windows-06-may-2014/3112)\n\n#### Installing on Mac OS X: \nRather than installing these packages from source, and instead of using MacPorts, it is relatively straightforward to use [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) to install `dfu-util`, `openssl`, and `libusb` (required for dfu-util). Once you have installed `brew` the basic command for each is `brew install dfu-util` . For the final step of `openssl` you will need to do `sudo brew install openssl` and enter your admin password.\n\nUpgrading\n---------------------------\nTo upgrade Spark-CLI, enter the following command:\n\n```sh\n$ npm update -g spark-cli\n```\n\n\nRunning from source (advanced)\n---------------------------\nTo grab the CLI source and play with it locally\n\n```sh\ngit clone git@github.com:spark/spark-cli.git\ncd spark-cli/js\nnpm install\nnode app.js help\n```\n\n\nGetting Started\n===============\n\n  These next two commands are all you need to get started setting up an account, claiming a core, and discovering new features.\n\n\n###spark setup\n\n  Guides you through creating a new account, and claiming your core!\n\n```sh\n$ spark setup\n```\n\n\n###spark help\n\n  Shows you what commands are available, and how to use them.  You can also give the name of a command for detailed help.\n  \n```sh\n$ spark help\n$ spark help keys \n```\n\nApply the CC3000 patch\n===\n\nThe easiest way to apply the CC3000 patch is to flash the known "cc3000" firmware followed by the "tinker" firmware over USB.\nNote, this process will soon be replaced by "deep update" that will streamline and simplify this process further. (see next section)\n\n1.) Make sure you have [dfu-util](http://dfu-util.gnumonks.org/) installed\n\n2.) Connect your core via usb, and place it into dfu mode by holding both buttons, and releasing reset, keep holding mode until your core flashes yellow.\n\n3.) Run `spark flash --usb cc3000`\n\nThis will run a special firmware program that will update the firmware running inside the CC3000 WiFi module.\nWhen it\'s done running, your core will be blinking yellow in dfu-mode, you\'ll need to flash regular firmware like Tinker\nto get connected and developing again.\n\n4.) Run `spark flash --usb tinker`\n\nThis will flash a new version of Tinker to your core and return to a blinking blue "listening" state, where\nyou can:\n\n5.) Run `spark setup` or `spark setup wifi` to provide your network credentials to get connected again.\n\n\nPerforming a "Deep update"\n================\n\nAny core shipped before Summer 2014 would benefit from having this update applied at least once.  It improves the core\'s performance on very busy networks, and helps fix other minor issues.  This update now ships with the cli so you can apply it to cores that are unable to get online otherwise.\n\n1.) Make sure you have [dfu-util](http://dfu-util.gnumonks.org/) installed\n\n2.) Connect your core via usb, and place it into dfu mode by holding both buttons, and releasing reset, keep holding mode until your core flashes yellow.\n\n3.) Run ```spark flash --usb deep_update_2014_06```\n\n4.) Your core should reboot and try to connect to any previously saved wifi networks, and then update itself again.\n\nCommand Reference\n================\n\n###spark setup wifi\n\n  Helpful shortcut for adding another wifi network to a core connected over USB.  Make sure your core is connected via a USB cable, and is slow blinking blue [listening mode](http://docs.spark.io/#/connect)\n\n```sh\n$ spark setup wifi\n```\n\n\n###spark login\n\n  Login and save an access token for interacting with your account on the Spark Cloud.\n\n```sh\n$ spark login\n```\n\n\n###spark logout\n\n  Logout and optionally revoke the access token for your CLI session.\n\n```sh\n$ spark logout\n```\n\n\n###spark list\n\n  Generates a list of what cores you own, and displays information about their status, including what variables and functions are available\n\n```sh\n$ spark list\n\nChecking with the cloud...\nRetrieving cores... (this might take a few seconds)\nmy_core_name (0123456789ABCDEFGHI) 0 variables, and 4 functions\n  Functions:\n    int digitalwrite(string)\n    int digitalread(string)\n    int analogwrite(string)\n    int analogread(string)\n\n```\n\n\n###spark core add\n\n  Adds a new core to your account\n\n```sh \n$ spark cloud claim 0123456789ABCDEFGHI\nClaiming core 0123456789ABCDEFGHI\nSuccessfully claimed core 0123456789ABCDEFGHI\n```\n\n\n###spark core rename\n\n  Assigns a new name to a core you\'ve claimed\n\n```sh\n$ spark core rename 0123456789ABCDEFGHI "pirate frosting"\n```\n\n\n\n###spark core remove\n\n  Removes a core from your account so someone else can claim it.\n\n```sh\n$ spark core remove 0123456789ABCDEFGHI\nAre you sure?  Please Type yes to continue: yes\nreleasing core 0123456789ABCDEFGHI\nserver said  { ok: true }\nOkay!\n```\n\n\n###spark flash\n\n  Sends a firmware binary, a source file, or a directory of source files, or a known app to your core.\n\n  Note!  When sending source code, the cloud compiles ```.ino``` and ```.cpp``` files differently.  For ```.ino``` files, the cloud will apply a pre-processor.  It will add missing function declarations, and it will inject an ```#include "\n  application.h"``` line at the top of your files if it is missing.\n\n  If you want to build a library that can be used for both Arduino and Spark, here\'s a useful code snippet:\n\n```cpp\n#if defined(ARDUINO) && ARDUINO >= 100\n#include "Arduino.h"\n#elif defined(SPARK)\n#include "application.h"\n#endif\n```\n\n\n####Flashing a directory\n\n  You can setup a directory of source files and libraries for your project, and the CLI will use those when compiling remotely.  You can also create ```spark.include``` and / or a ```spark.ignore``` file in that directory that will tell the CLI specifically which files to use or ignore.\n\n```sh\n$ spark flash 0123456789ABCDEFGHI my_project\n```\n\n\n####Flashing one or more source files\n\n  You can include any number of individual source files after the device id, and the CLI will include them while flashing your app.\n\n\n```sh\n$ spark flash 0123456789ABCDEFGHI app.ino library1.cpp library1.h\n```\n\n\n####Flashing a known app\n\n  You can easily reset a core back to a previous existing app with a quick command. Three app names are reserved right now: "tinker", "voodoo", and "cc3000".  Tinker is the original firmware that ships with the core, and cc3000 will patch the wifi module on your Core. Voodoo is a build of [VoodooSpark](http://voodoospark.me/) to allow local wireless firmata control of a core.\n\n```sh\n$ spark flash 0123456789ABCDEFGHI tinker\n$ spark flash 0123456789ABCDEFGHI cc3000\n$ spark flash 0123456789ABCDEFGHI voodoo\n\n```\n\n  You can also update the factory reset version using the --factory flag, and over usb with --usb\n\n```sh\n$ spark flash --factory tinker\n$ spark flash --usb tinker\n```\n\n\n####Compiling remotely and Flashing locally\n\nTo work locally, but use the cloud compiler, simply use the compile command, and then the local flash command after.  Make sure you connect your core via USB and place it into [dfu mode](http://docs.spark.io/#/connect/appendix-dfu-mode-device-firmware-upgrade).\n\n```sh\n$ spark compile my_project_folder --saveTo firmware.bin\nOR\n$ spark compile app.ino library1.cpp library1.h --saveTo firmware.bin\n$ spark flash --usb firmware.bin\n```\n\n\n###spark compile\n\n  Compiles one or more source file, or a directory of source files, and downloads a firmware binary.\n\n  Note!  The cloud compiles ```.ino``` and ```.cpp``` files differently.  For ```.ino``` files, the cloud will apply a pre-processor.  It will add missing function declarations, and it will inject an ```#include "\n  application.h"``` line at the top of your files if it is missing.\n\n  If you want to build a library that can be used for both Arduino and Spark, here\'s a useful code snippet:\n\n```cpp\n#if defined(ARDUINO) && ARDUINO >= 100\n#include "Arduino.h"\n#elif defined(SPARK)\n#include "application.h"\n#endif\n```\n\n\n####compiling a directory\n\n  You can setup a directory of source files and libraries for your project, and the CLI will use those when compiling remotely.  You can also create ```spark.include``` and / or a ```spark.ignore``` file in that directory that will tell the CLI specifically which files to use or ignore.  Those files are just plain text with one line per filename\n\n```sh\n$ spark compile my_project_folder\n```\n\n\n####example spark.include\n```text\napplication.cpp\nlibrary1.h\nlibrary1.cpp\n```\n\n\n####example spark.ignore\n```text\n.ds_store\nlogo.png\nold_version.cpp\n```\n\n\n####Compiling one or more source files\n\n  You can include any number of individual source files after the device id, and the CLI will include them while compiling your app.\n\n\n```sh\n$ spark compile app.ino library1.cpp library1.h\n```\n####Compiling in a directory containing project files\n\n This will push all the files in a directory that the command line is currently \'cd\' in for compilation.\n \n ```sh\n $ spark compile .\n ```\n\n\n\n\n###spark call\n\n  Calls a function on one of your cores, use ```spark list``` to see which cores are online, and what functions are available.\n\n```sh\n$ spark call 0123456789ABCDEFGHI digitalwrite "D7,HIGH"\n1\n```\n\n\n###spark get\n\n  Retrieves a variable value from one of your cores, use ```spark list``` to see which cores are online, and what variables are available.\n\n```sh\n$ spark get 0123456789ABCDEFGHI temperature\n72.1\n```\n\n\n\n###spark monitor\n\n  Pulls the value of a variable at a set interval, and optionally display a timestamp\n  \n  * Minimum delay for now is 500 (there is a check anyway if you keyed anything less)\n  * hitting ```CTRL + C``` in the console will exit the monitoring\n\n```sh\n$ spark monitor 0123456789ABCDEFGHI temperature 5000\n$ spark monitor 0123456789ABCDEFGHI temperature 5000 --time\n$ spark monitor all temperature 5000\n$ spark monitor all temperature 5000 --time\n$ spark monitor all temperature 5000 --time > my_temperatures.csv\n```\n\n\n###spark identify\n\n  Retrieves your core id when the core is connected via USB and in listening mode (flashing blue).\n\n```sh\n$ spark identify\n$ spark identify 1\n$ spark identify COM3\n$ spark identify /dev/cu.usbmodem12345\n\n$ spark identify\n0123456789ABCDEFGHI\n```\n\n###spark subscribe\n\n  Subscribes to published events on the cloud, and pipes them to the console.  Special core name "mine" will subscribe to events from just your cores.\n\n\n```sh \n$ spark subscribe\n$ spark subscribe mine\n$ spark subscribe eventName\n$ spark subscribe eventName mine\n$ spark subscribe eventName CoreName\n$ spark subscribe eventName 0123456789ABCDEFGHI\n```\n\n\n\n\n###spark serial list\n\n  Shows currently connected Spark Core\'s acting as serial devices over USB\n\n```sh\n$ spark serial list\n```\n\n\n###spark serial monitor\n\n  Starts listening to the specified serial device, and echoes to the terminal\n\n```sh\n$ spark serial monitor\n$ spark serial monitor 1\n$ spark serial monitor COM3\n$ spark serial monitor /dev/cu.usbmodem12345\n```\n\n\n###spark keys doctor\n\nHelps you update your keys, or recover your core when the keys on the server are out of sync with the keys on your core.  The ```spark keys``` tools requires both dfu-util, and openssl to be installed.\n\nConnect your core in [dfu mode](http://docs.spark.io/#/connect/appendix-dfu-mode-device-firmware-upgrade), and run this command to replace the unique cryptographic keys on your core.  Automatically attempts to send the new public key to the cloud as well.\n\n```sh\n$ spark keys doctor 0123456789ABCDEFGHI\n```\n\nThere have been reports of the new public key not being sent to the cloud, in which case ```spark keys send``` will need to be run manually.\n\n###spark keys new\n\nGenerates a new public / private keypair that can be used on a core.\n\n```sh\n$ spark keys new\nrunning openssl genrsa -out core.pem 1024\nrunning openssl rsa -in core.pem -pubout -out core.pub.pem\nrunning openssl rsa -in core.pem -outform DER -out core.der\nNew Key Created!\n\n$ spark keys new mykey\nrunning openssl genrsa -out mykey.pem 1024\nrunning openssl rsa -in mykey.pem -pubout -out mykey.pub.pem\nrunning openssl rsa -in mykey.pem -outform DER -out mykey.der\nNew Key Created!\n```\n\n###spark keys load\n\nCopies a ```.DER``` formatted private key onto your core\'s external flash.  Make sure your core is connected and in [dfu mode](http://docs.spark.io/#/connect/appendix-dfu-mode-device-firmware-upgrade).  The ```spark keys``` tools requires both dfu-util, and openssl to be installed.  Make sure any key you load is sent to the cloud with ```spark keys send core.pub.pem```\n\n```sh\n$ spark keys load core.der\n...\nSaved!\n```\n\n###spark keys save\n\nCopies a ```.DER``` formatted private key from your core\'s external flash to your computer.  Make sure your core is connected and in [dfu mode](http://docs.spark.io/#/connect/appendix-dfu-mode-device-firmware-upgrade).  The ```spark keys``` tools requires both dfu-util, and openssl to be installed.\n\n```sh\n$ spark keys save core.der\n...\nSaved!\n```\n\n###spark keys send\n\nSends a core\'s public key to the cloud for use in opening an encrypted session with your core.  Please make sure your core has the corresponding private key loaded using the ```spark keys load``` command.\n\n```sh\n$ spark keys send 0123456789ABCDEFGHI core.pub.pem\nsubmitting public key succeeded!\n```\n\n###spark keys server\n\nSwitches the server public key stored on the core\'s external flash.  This command is important when changing which server your core is connecting to, and the server public key helps protect your connection.   Your core will stay in DFU mode after this command, so that you can load new firmware to connect to your server.\n\nComing Soon - more commands to make it easier to change the server settings on your core!\n\n\n```sh\n$ spark keys server my_server.der\nOkay!  New keys in place, your core will not restart.\n```\n\n\n###spark keys server ip_address\n\nWhen using the local cloud you can ask the CLI to encode the IP or dns address into your key to control where your core will connect.\n\n```sh\n$ spark keys server my_server.pub.pem 192.168.1.10\n$ spark keys server my_server.der 192.168.1.10\n```\n\n###spark config\n\nThe config command lets you create groups of settings and quickly switch to a profile by calling `spark config profile-name`. This is especially useful for switching to your local server or between other environments.\n\nCalling `spark config spark` will switch **Spark-Cli** back to the Spark Cloud API server.\n\n```sh\n$ spark config profile-name\n$ spark config spark\n$ spark config local apiUrl http://localhost:8080  //creates a new profile with name "local" and saves the IP-address parameter\n$ spark config useSudoForDfu true\n```\n\nCalling `spark config identify` will output your current config settings.\n```sh\n$ spark config identify\nCurrent profile: spark\nUsing API: https://api.spark.io\nAccess token: e671fadd500a8a3921bb78c8d0400d7ba450a847\n```\n',

It uses the `minimatch`\nlibrary to do its matching.\n\n![](oh-my-glob.gif)\n\n## Usage\n\n```javascript\nvar glob = require("glob")\n\n// options is optional\nglob("**/*.js", options, function (er, files) {\n  // files is an array of filenames.\n  // If the `nonull` option is set, and nothing\n  // was found, then files is ["**/*.js"]\n  // er is an error object or null.\n})\n```\n\n## Glob Primer\n\n"Globs" are the patterns you type when you do stuff like `ls *.js` on\nthe command line, or put `build/*` in a `.gitignore` file.\n\nBefore parsing the path part patterns, braced sections are expanded\ninto a set.  Braced sections start with `{` and end with `}`, with any\nnumber of comma-delimited sections within.  Braced sections may contain\nslash characters, so `a{/b/c,bcd}` would expand into `a/b/c` and `abcd`.\n\nThe following characters have special magic meaning when used in a\npath portion:\n\n* `*` Matches 0 or more characters in a single path portion\n* `?` Matches 1 character\n* `[...]` Matches a range of characters, similar to a RegExp range.\n  If the first character of the range is `!` or `^` then it matches\n  any character not in the range.\n* `!(pattern|pattern|pattern)` Matches anything that does not match\n  any of the patterns provided.\n* `?(pattern|pattern|pattern)` Matches zero or one occurrence of the\n  patterns provided.\n* `+(pattern|pattern|pattern)` Matches one or more occurrences of the\n  patterns provided.\n* `*(a|b|c)` Matches zero or more occurrences of the patterns provided\n* `@(pattern|pat*|pat?erN)` Matches exactly one of the patterns\n  provided\n* `**` If a "globstar" is alone in a path portion, then it matches\n  zero or more directories and subdirectories searching for matches.\n  It does not crawl symlinked directories.\n\n### Dots\n\nIf a file or directory path portion has a `.` as the first character,\nthen it will not match any glob pattern unless that pattern\'s\ncorresponding path part also has a `.` as its first character.\n\nFor example, the pattern `a/.*/c` would match the file at `a/.b/c`.\nHowever the pattern `a/*/c` would not, because `*` does not start with\na dot character.\n\nYou can make glob treat dots as normal characters by setting\n`dot:true` in the options.\n\n### Basename Matching\n\nIf you set `matchBase:true` in the options, and the pattern has no\nslashes in it, then it will seek for any file anywhere in the tree\nwith a matching basename.  For example, `*.js` would match\n`test/simple/basic.js`.\n\n### Negation\n\nThe intent for negation would be for a pattern starting with `!` to\nmatch everything that *doesn\'t* match the supplied pattern.  However,\nthe implementation is weird, and for the time being, this should be\navoided.  The behavior will change or be deprecated in version 5.\n\n### Empty Sets\n\nIf no matching files are found, then an empty array is returned.  This\ndiffers from the shell, where the pattern itself is returned.  For\nexample:\n\n    $ echo a*s*d*f\n    a*s*d*f\n\nTo get the bash-style behavior, set the `nonull:true` in the options.\n\n### See Also:\n\n* `man sh`\n* `man bash` (Search for "Pattern Matching")\n* `man 3 fnmatch`\n* `man 5 gitignore`\n* [minimatch documentation](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch)\n\n## glob.hasMagic(pattern, [options])\n\nReturns `true` if there are any special characters in the pattern, and\n`false` otherwise.\n\nNote that the options affect the results.  If `noext:true` is set in\nthe options object, then `+(a|b)` will not be considered a magic\npattern.  If the pattern has a brace expansion, like `a/{b/c,x/y}`\nthen that is considered magical, unless `nobrace:true` is set in the\noptions.\n\n## glob(pattern, [options], cb)\n\n* `pattern` {String} Pattern to be matched\n* `options` {Object}\n* `cb` {Function}\n  * `err` {Error | null}\n  * `matches` {Array<String>} filenames found matching the pattern\n\nPerform an asynchronous glob search.\n\n## glob.sync(pattern, [options])\n\n* `pattern` {String} Pattern to be matched\n* `options` {Object}\n* return: {Array<String>} filenames found matching the pattern\n\nPerform a synchronous glob search.\n\n## Class: glob.Glob\n\nCreate a Glob object by instantiating the `glob.Glob` class.\n\n```javascript\nvar Glob = require("glob").Glob\nvar mg = new Glob(pattern, options, cb)\n```\n\nIt\'s an EventEmitter, and starts walking the filesystem to find matches\nimmediately.\n\n### new glob.Glob(pattern, [options], [cb])\n\n* `pattern` {String} pattern to search for\n* `options` {Object}\n* `cb` {Function} Called when an error occurs, or matches are found\n  * `err` {Error | null}\n  * `matches` {Array<String>} filenames found matching the pattern\n\nNote that if the `sync` flag is set in the options, then matches will\nbe immediately available on the `g.found` member.\n\n### Properties\n\n* `minimatch` The minimatch object that the glob uses.\n* `options` The options object passed in.\n* `aborted` Boolean which is set to true when calling `abort()`.  There\n  is no way at this time to continue a glob search after aborting, but\n  you can re-use the statCache to avoid having to duplicate syscalls.\n* `statCache` Collection of all the stat results the glob search\n  performed.\n* `cache` Convenience object.  Each field has the following possible\n  values:\n  * `false` - Path does not exist\n  * `true` - Path exists\n  * `\'DIR\'` - Path exists, and is not a directory\n  * `\'FILE\'` - Path exists, and is a directory\n  * `[file, entries, ...]` - Path exists, is a directory, and the\n    array value is the results of `fs.readdir`\n* `statCache` Cache of `fs.stat` results, to prevent statting the same\n  path multiple times.\n* `symlinks` A record of which paths are symbolic links, which is\n  relevant in resolving `**` patterns.\n* `realpathCache` An optional object which is passed to `fs.realpath`\n  to minimize unnecessary syscalls.  It is stored on the instantiated\n  Glob object, and may be re-used.\n\n### Events\n\n* `end` When the matching is finished, this is emitted with all the\n  matches found.  If the `nonull` option is set, and no match was found,\n  then the `matches` list contains the original pattern.  The matches\n  are sorted, unless the `nosort` flag is set.\n* `match` Every time a match is found, this is emitted with the matched.\n* `error` Emitted when an unexpected error is encountered, or whenever\n  any fs error occurs if `options.strict` is set.\n* `abort` When `abort()` is called, this event is raised.\n\n### Methods\n\n* `pause` Temporarily stop the search\n* `resume` Resume the search\n* `abort` Stop the search forever\n\n### Options\n\nAll the options that can be passed to Minimatch can also be passed to\nGlob to change pattern matching behavior.  Also, some have been added,\nor have glob-specific ramifications.\n\nAll options are false by default, unless otherwise noted.\n\nAll options are added to the Glob object, as well.\n\nIf you are running many `glob` operations, you can pass a Glob object\nas the `options` argument to a subsequent operation to shortcut some\n`stat` and `readdir` calls.  At the very least, you may pass in shared\n`symlinks`, `statCache`, `realpathCache`, and `cache` options, so that\nparallel glob operations will be sped up by sharing information about\nthe filesystem.\n\n* `cwd` The current working directory in which to search.  Defaults\n  to `process.cwd()`.\n* `root` The place where patterns starting with `/` will be mounted\n  onto.  Defaults to `path.resolve(options.cwd, "/")` (`/` on Unix\n  systems, and `C:\\` or some such on Windows.)\n* `dot` Include `.dot` files in normal matches and `globstar` matches.\n  Note that an explicit dot in a portion of the pattern will always\n  match dot files.\n* `nomount` By default, a pattern starting with a forward-slash will be\n  "mounted" onto the root setting, so that a valid filesystem path is\n  returned.  Set this flag to disable that behavior.\n* `mark` Add a `/` character to directory matches.  Note that this\n  requires additional stat calls.\n* `nosort` Don\'t sort the results.\n* `stat` Set to true to stat *all* results.  This reduces performance\n  somewhat, and is completely unnecessary, unless `readdir` is presumed\n  to be an untrustworthy indicator of file existence.\n* `silent` When an unusual error is encountered when attempting to\n  read a directory, a warning will be printed to stderr.  Set the\n  `silent` option to true to suppress these warnings.\n* `strict` When an unusual error is encountered when attempting to\n  read a directory, the process will just continue on in search of\n  other matches.  Set the `strict` option to raise an error in these\n  cases.\n* `cache` See `cache` property above.  Pass in a previously generated\n  cache object to save some fs calls.\n* `statCache` A cache of results of filesystem information, to prevent\n  unnecessary stat calls.  While it should not normally be necessary\n  to set this, you may pass the statCache from one glob() call to the\n  options object of another, if you know that the filesystem will not\n  change between calls.  (See "Race Conditions" below.)\n* `symlinks` A cache of known symbolic links.  You may pass in a\n  previously generated `symlinks` object to save `lstat` calls when\n  resolving `**` matches.\n* `sync` DEPRECATED: use `glob.sync(pattern, opts)` instead.\n* `nounique` In some cases, brace-expanded patterns can result in the\n  same file showing up multiple times in the result set.  By default,\n  this implementation prevents duplicates in the result set.  Set this\n  flag to disable that behavior.\n* `nonull` Set to never return an empty set, instead returning a set\n  containing the pattern itself.  This is the default in glob(3).\n* `debug` Set to enable debug logging in minimatch and glob.\n* `nobrace` Do not expand `{a,b}` and `{1..3}` brace sets.\n* `noglobstar` Do not match `**` against multiple filenames.  (Ie,\n  treat it as a normal `*` instead.)\n* `noext` Do not match `+(a|b)` "extglob" patterns.\n* `nocase` Perform a case-insensitive match.  Note: on\n  case-insensitive filesystems, non-magic patterns will match by\n  default, since `stat` and `readdir` will not raise errors.\n* `matchBase` Perform a basename-only match if the pattern does not\n  contain any slash characters.  That is, `*.js` would be treated as\n  equivalent to `**/*.js`, matching all js files in all directories.\n* `nonegate` Suppress `negate` behavior.  (See below.)\n* `nocomment` Suppress `comment` behavior.  (See below.)\n* `nonull` Return the pattern when no matches are found.\n* `nodir` Do not match directories, only files.  (Note: to match\n  *only* directories, simply put a `/` at the end of the pattern.)\n* `ignore` Add a pattern or an array of patterns to exclude matches.\n* `follow` Follow symlinked directories when expanding `**` patterns.\n  Note that this can result in a lot of duplicate references in the\n  presence of cyclic links.\n* `realpath` Set to true to call `fs.realpath` on all of the results.\n  In the case of a symlink that cannot be resolved, the full absolute\n  path to the matched entry is returned (though it will usually be a\n  broken symlink)\n\n## Comparisons to other fnmatch/glob implementations\n\nWhile strict compliance with the existing standards is a worthwhile\ngoal, some discrepancies exist between node-glob and other\nimplementations, and are intentional.\n\nIf the pattern starts with a `!` character, then it is negated.  Set the\n`nonegate` flag to suppress this behavior, and treat leading `!`\ncharacters normally.  This is perhaps relevant if you wish to start the\npattern with a negative extglob pattern like `!(a|B)`.  Multiple `!`\ncharacters at the start of a pattern will negate the pattern multiple\ntimes.\n\nIf a pattern starts with `#`, then it is treated as a comment, and\nwill not match anything.  Use `\\#` to match a literal `#` at the\nstart of a line, or set the `nocomment` flag to suppress this behavior.\n\nThe double-star character `**` is supported by default, unless the\n`noglobstar` flag is set.  This is supported in the manner of bsdglob\nand bash 4.3, where `**` only has special significance if it is the only\nthing in a path part.  That is, `a/**/b` will match `a/x/y/b`, but\n`a/**b` will not.\n\nNote that symlinked directories are not crawled as part of a `**`,\nthough their contents may match against subsequent portions of the\npattern.  This prevents infinite loops and duplicates and the like.\n\nIf an escaped pattern has no matches, and the `nonull` flag is set,\nthen glob returns the pattern as-provided, rather than\ninterpreting the character escapes.  For example,\n`glob.match([], "\\\\*a\\\\?")` will return `"\\\\*a\\\\?"` rather than\n`"*a?"`.  This is akin to setting the `nullglob` option in bash, except\nthat it does not resolve escaped pattern characters.\n\nIf brace expansion is not disabled, then it is performed before any\nother interpretation of the glob pattern.  Thus, a pattern like\n`+(a|{b),c)}`, which would not be valid in bash or zsh, is expanded\n**first** into the set of `+(a|b)` and `+(a|c)`, and those patterns are\nchecked for validity.  Since those two are valid, matching proceeds.\n\n## Windows\n\n**Please only use forward-slashes in glob expressions.**\n\nThough windows uses either `/` or `\\` as its path separator, only `/`\ncharacters are used by this glob implementation.  You must use\nforward-slashes **only** in glob expressions.  Back-slashes will always\nbe interpreted as escape characters, not path separators.\n\nResults from absolute patterns such as `/foo/*` are mounted onto the\nroot setting using `path.join`.  On windows, this will by default result\nin `/foo/*` matching `C:\\foo\\bar.txt`.\n\n## Race Conditions\n\nGlob searching, by its very nature, is susceptible to race conditions,\nsince it relies on directory walking and such.\n\nAs a result, it is possible that a file that exists when glob looks for\nit may have been deleted or modified by the time it returns the result.\n\nAs part of its internal implementation, this program caches all stat\nand readdir calls that it makes, in order to cut down on system\noverhead.  However, this also makes it even more susceptible to races,\nespecially if the cache or statCache objects are reused between glob\ncalls.\n\nUsers are thus advised not to use a glob result as a guarantee of\nfilesystem state in the face of rapid changes.  For the vast majority\nof operations, this is never a problem.\n\n## Contributing\n\nAny change to behavior (including bugfixes) must come with a test.\n\nPatches that fail tests or reduce performance will be rejected.\n\n```\n# to run tests\nnpm test\n\n# to re-generate test fixtures\nnpm run test-regen\n\n# to benchmark against bash/zsh\nnpm run bench\n\n# to profile javascript\nnpm run prof\n```\n',

It\'s a powerful combination of small size, high performance, debuggability, and rich features:\n\n* Resolve arrays and hashes of promises, as well as infinite promise sequences\n* Execute tasks in parallel or sequentially\n* Transform Node-style and other callback-based APIs into promise-based APIs\n\nWhen.js is one of the many stand-alone components of [cujoJS](http://cujojs.com), the JavaScript Architectural Toolkit. \n\nCheck it out:\n\n- [What\'s new](CHANGES.md)\n- [API docs](docs/api.md#api)\n- Read more about how [promises simplify async programming](http://know.cujojs.com/tutorials/async/simplifying-async-with-promises)\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n#### AMD\n\nAvailble as `when` through [bower](http://bower.io), or just clone the repo and load `when.js` from the root.\n\n```\nbower install --save when\n```\n\n#### CommonJS/Node\n\n```\nnpm install --save when\n```\n\n[More help & other environments &raquo;](docs/installation.md)\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nPromises can be used to help manage complex and/or nested callback flows in a simple manner. To get a better handle on how promise flows look and how they can be helpful, there are a couple examples below (using commonjs).\n\nThis first example will print `"hello world!!!!"` if all went well, or `"drat!"` if there was a problem. It also uses [rest](https://github.com/cujojs/rest) to make an ajax request to a (fictional) external service.\n\n```js\nvar rest = require(\'rest\');\n\nfetchRemoteGreeting()\n    .then(addExclamation)\n    .catch(handleError)\n    .done(function(greeting) {\n        console.log(greeting);\n    });\n\nfunction fetchRemoteGreeting() {\n    // returns a when.js promise for \'hello world\'\n    return rest(\'http://example.com/greeting\');\n}\n\nfunction addExclamation(greeting) {\n    return greeting + \'!!!!\'\n}\n\nfunction handleError(e) {\n    return \'drat!\';\n}\n```\n\nThe second example shows off the power that comes with when\'s promise logic. Here, we get an array of numbers from a remote source and reduce them. The example will print `150` if all went well, and if there was a problem will print a full stack trace.\n\n```js\nvar when = require(\'when\');\nvar rest = require(\'rest\');\n\nwhen.reduce(when.map(getRemoteNumberList(), times10), sum)\n    .done(function(result) {\n        console.log(result);\n    });\n\nfunction getRemoteNumberList() {\n    // Get a remote array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    return rest(\'http://example.com/numbers\').then(JSON.parse);\n}\n\nfunction sum(x, y) { return x + y; }\nfunction times10(x) {return x * 10; }\n```\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nLicensed under MIT.

2803 silly resolved     readme: '## Hogan.js - A mustache compiler.\n\n[Hogan.js](http://twitter.github.com/hogan.js/) is a compiler for the\n[Mustache](http://mustache.github.com/) templating language. For information\non Mustache, see the [manpage](http://mustache.github.com/mustache.5.html) and\nthe [spec](https://github.com/mustache/spec).\n\n## Basics\n\nHogan compiles templates to HoganTemplate objects, which have a render method.\n\n```js\nvar data = {\n  screenName: "dhg",\n};\n\nvar template = Hogan.compile("Follow @{{screenName}}.");\nvar output = template.render(data);\n\n// prints "Follow @dhg."\nconsole.log(output);\n```\n\n## Features\n\nHogan is fast--try it on your workload.\n\nHogan has separate scanning, parsing and code generation phases. This way it\'s\npossible to add new features without touching the scanner at all, and many\ndifferent code generation techniques can be tried without changing the parser.\n\nHogan exposes scan and parse methods. These can be useful for\npre-processing templates on the server.\n\n```js\nvar text = "{{^check}}{{#i18n}}No{{/i18n}}{{/check}}";\ntext +=  "{{#check}}{{#i18n}}Yes{{/i18n}}{{/check}}";\nvar tree = Hogan.parse(Hogan.scan(text));\n\n// outputs "# check"\nconsole.log(tree[0].tag + " " + tree[0].name);\n\n// outputs "Yes"\nconsole.log(tree[1].nodes[0].nodes[0]);\n```\n\nIt\'s also possible to use HoganTemplate objects without the Hogan compiler\npresent. That means you can pre-compile your templates on the server, and\navoid shipping the compiler. However, the optional lambda features from the\nMustache spec do require the compiler to be present.\n\n## Why Hogan.js?\n\nWhy another templating library?\n\nHogan.js was written to meet three templating library requirements: good\nperformance, standalone template objects, and a parser API.\n\n## Issues\n\nHave a bug? Please create an issue here on GitHub!\n\nhttps://github.com/twitter/hogan.js/issues\n\n## Versioning\n\nFor transparency and insight into our release cycle, releases will be numbered with the follow format:\n\n`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`\n\nAnd constructed with the following guidelines:\n\n* Breaking backwards compatibility bumps the major\n* New additions without breaking backwards compatibility bumps the minor\n* Bug fixes and misc changes bump the patch\n\nFor more information on semantic versioning, please visit http://semver.org/.\n\n## Authors\n\n**Robert Sayre**\n\n+ http://github.com/sayrer\n\n**Jacob Thornton**\n\n+ http://github.com/fat\n\n## License\n\nCopyright 2011 Twitter, Inc.\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0: http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0',

Previously `moment.js`, `locale/*.js` and\n`test/moment/*.js`, `test/locale/*.js` contained the source of the project. Now\nthe source is in `src/`, temporary build (es5) files are placed under\n`build/umd/` (for running tests during development), and the `moment.js` and\n`locale/*.js` files are updated only on release.\n\nIf you want to use a particular revision of the code, make sure to run\n`grunt transpile update-index`, so `moment.js` and `locales/*.js` are synced\nwith `src/*`. We might place that in a commit hook in the future.\n\n## Upgrading to 2.0.0\n\nThere are a number of small backwards incompatible changes with version 2.0.0. [See the full descriptions here](https://gist.github.com/timrwood/e72f2eef320ed9e37c51#backwards-incompatible-changes)\n\n * Changed language ordinal method to return the number + ordinal instead of just the ordinal.\n\n * Changed two digit year parsing cutoff to match strptime.\n\n * Removed `moment#sod` and `moment#eod` in favor of `moment#startOf` and `moment#endOf`.\n\n * Removed `moment.humanizeDuration()` in favor of `moment.duration().humanize()`.\n\n * Removed the lang data objects from the top level namespace.\n\n * Duplicate `Date` passed to `moment()` instead of referencing it.\n\n## [Changelog](https://github.com/moment/moment/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md)\n\n## [Contributing](https://github.com/moment/moment/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\nWe\'re looking for co-maintainers!

This method will also check the file extension against a mapping of file extensions to content-types (in this case `application/json`) and use the proper `content-type` in the PUT request (if the headers don’t already provide one).\n\n```js\nfs.createReadStream(\'file.json\').pipe(request.put(\'http://mysite.com/obj.json\'))\n```\n\nRequest can also `pipe` to itself. When doing so, `content-type` and `content-length` are preserved in the PUT headers.\n\n```js\nrequest.get(\'http://google.com/img.png\').pipe(request.put(\'http://mysite.com/img.png\'))\n```\n\nRequest emits a "response" event when a response is received. The `response` argument will be an instance of [http.IncomingMessage](http://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_http_incomingmessage).\n\n```js\nrequest\n  .get(\'http://google.com/img.png\')\n  .on(\'response\', function(response) {\n    console.log(response.statusCode) // 200\n    console.log(response.headers[\'content-type\']) // \'image/png\'\n  })\n  .pipe(request.put(\'http://mysite.com/img.png\'))\n```\n\nTo easily handle errors when streaming requests, listen to the `error` event before piping:\n\n```js\nrequest\n  .get(\'http://mysite.com/doodle.png\')\n  .on(\'error\', function(err) {\n    console.log(err)\n  })\n  .pipe(fs.createWriteStream(\'doodle.png\'))\n```\n\nNow let’s get fancy.\n\n```js\nhttp.createServer(function (req, resp) {\n  if (req.url === \'/doodle.png\') {\n    if (req.method === \'PUT\') {\n      req.pipe(request.put(\'http://mysite.com/doodle.png\'))\n    } else if (req.method === \'GET\' || req.method === \'HEAD\') {\n      request.get(\'http://mysite.com/doodle.png\').pipe(resp)\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\nYou can also `pipe()` from `http.ServerRequest` instances, as well as to `http.ServerResponse` instances. The HTTP method, headers, and entity-body data will be sent. Which means that, if you don\'t really care about security, you can do:\n\n```js\nhttp.createServer(function (req, resp) {\n  if (req.url === \'/doodle.png\') {\n    var x = request(\'http://mysite.com/doodle.png\')\n    req.pipe(x)\n    x.pipe(resp)\n  }\n})\n```\n\nAnd since `pipe()` returns the destination stream in ≥ Node 0.5.x you can do one line proxying. :)\n\n```js\nreq.pipe(request(\'http://mysite.com/doodle.png\')).pipe(resp)\n```\n\nAlso, none of this new functionality conflicts with requests previous features, it just expands them.\n\n```js\nvar r = request.defaults({\'proxy\':\'http://localproxy.com\'})\n\nhttp.createServer(function (req, resp) {\n  if (req.url === \'/doodle.png\') {\n    r.get(\'http://google.com/doodle.png\').pipe(resp)\n  }\n})\n```\n\nYou can still use intermediate proxies, the requests will still follow HTTP forwards, etc.\n\n[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n\n---\n\n\n## Forms\n\n`request` supports `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` and `multipart/form-data` form uploads. For `multipart/related` refer to the `multipart` API.\n\n\n#### application/x-www-form-urlencoded (URL-Encoded Forms)\n\nURL-encoded forms are simple.\n\n```js\nrequest.post(\'http://service.com/upload\', {form:{key:\'value\'}})\n// or\nrequest.post(\'http://service.com/upload\').form({key:\'value\'})\n// or\nrequest.post({url:\'http://service.com/upload\', form: {key:\'value\'}}, function(err,httpResponse,body){ /* ... */ })\n```\n\n\n#### multipart/form-data (Multipart Form Uploads)\n\nFor `multipart/form-data` we use the [form-data](https://github.com/felixge/node-form-data) library by [@felixge](https://github.com/felixge). For the most cases, you can pass your upload form data via the `formData` option.\n\n\n```js\nvar formData = {\n  // Pass a simple key-value pair\n  my_field: \'my_value\',\n  // Pass data via Buffers\n  my_buffer: new Buffer([1, 2, 3]),\n  // Pass data via Streams\n  my_file: fs.createReadStream(__dirname + \'/unicycle.jpg\'),\n  // Pass multiple values /w an Array\n  attachments: [\n    fs.createReadStream(__dirname + \'/attachment1.jpg\'),\n    fs.createReadStream(__dirname + \'/attachment2.jpg\')\n  ],\n  // Pass optional meta-data with an \'options\' object with style: {value: DATA, options: OPTIONS}\n  // Use case: for some types of streams, you\'ll need to provide "file"-related information manually.\n  // See the `form-data` README for more information about options: https://github.com/felixge/node-form-data\n  custom_file: {\n    value:  fs.createReadStream(\'/dev/urandom\'),\n    options: {\n      filename: \'topsecret.jpg\',\n      contentType: \'image/jpg\'\n    }\n  }\n};\nrequest.post({url:\'http://service.com/upload\', formData: formData}, function optionalCallback(err, httpResponse, body) {\n  if (err) {\n    return console.error(\'upload failed:\', err);\n  }\n  console.log(\'Upload successful!  Server responded with:\', body);\n});\n```\n\nFor advanced cases, you can access the form-data object itself via `r.form()`. This can be modified until the request is fired on the next cycle of the event-loop. (Note that this calling `form()` will clear the currently set form data for that request.)\n\n```js\n// NOTE: Advanced use-case, for normal use see \'formData\' usage above\nvar r = request.post(\'http://service.com/upload\', function optionalCallback(err, httpResponse, body) { // ...\n\nvar form = r.form();\nform.append(\'my_field\', \'my_value\');\nform.append(\'my_buffer\', new Buffer([1, 2, 3]));\nform.append(\'custom_file\', fs.createReadStream(__dirname + \'/unicycle.jpg\'), {filename: \'unicycle.jpg\'});\n```\nSee the [form-data README](https://github.com/felixge/node-form-data) for more information & examples.\n\n\n#### multipart/related\n\nSome variations in different HTTP implementations require a newline/CRLF before, after, or both before and after the boundary of a `multipart/related` request (using the multipart option). This has been observed in the .NET WebAPI version 4.0. You can turn on a boundary preambleCRLF or postamble by passing them as `true` to your request options.\n\n```js\n  request({\n    method: \'PUT\',\n    preambleCRLF: true,\n    postambleCRLF: true,\n    uri: \'http://service.com/upload\',\n    multipart: [\n      {\n        \'content-type\': \'application/json\'\n        body: JSON.stringify({foo: \'bar\', _attachments: {\'message.txt\': {follows: true, length: 18, \'content_type\': \'text/plain\' }}})\n      },\n      { body: \'I am an attachment\' },\n      { body: fs.createReadStream(\'image.png\') }\n    ],\n    // alternatively pass an object containing additional options\n    multipart: {\n      chunked: false,\n      data: [\n        {\n          \'content-type\': \'application/json\',\n          body: JSON.stringify({foo: \'bar\', _attachments: {\'message.txt\': {follows: true, length: 18, \'content_type\': \'text/plain\' }}})\n        },\n        { body: \'I am an attachment\' }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  function (error, response, body) {\n    if (error) {\n      return console.error(\'upload failed:\', error);\n    }\n    console.log(\'Upload successful!  Server responded with:\', body);\n  })\n```\n\n[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n\n---\n\n\n## HTTP Authentication\n\n```js\nrequest.get(\'http://some.server.com/\').auth(\'username\', \'password\', false);\n// or\nrequest.get(\'http://some.server.com/\', {\n  \'auth\': {\n    \'user\': \'username\',\n    \'pass\': \'password\',\n    \'sendImmediately\': false\n  }\n});\n// or\nrequest.get(\'http://some.server.com/\').auth(null, null, true, \'bearerToken\');\n// or\nrequest.get(\'http://some.server.com/\', {\n  \'auth\': {\n    \'bearer\': \'bearerToken\'\n  }\n});\n```\n\nIf passed as an option, `auth` should be a hash containing values:\n\n- `user` || `username`\n- `pass` || `password`\n- `sendImmediately` (optional)\n- `bearer` (optional)\n\nThe method form takes parameters\n`auth(username, password, sendImmediately, bearer)`.\n\n`sendImmediately` defaults to `true`, which causes a basic or bearer\nauthentication header to be sent.  If `sendImmediately` is `false`, then\n`request` will retry with a proper authentication header after receiving a\n`401` response from the server (which must contain a `WWW-Authenticate` header\nindicating the required authentication method).\n\nNote that you can also specify basic authentication using the URL itself, as\ndetailed in [RFC 1738](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1738.txt).  Simply pass the\n`user:password` before the host with an `@` sign:\n\n```js\nvar username = \'username\',\n    password = \'password\',\n    url = \'http://\' + username + \':\' + password + \'@some.server.com\';\n\nrequest({url: url}, function (error, response, body) {\n   // Do more stuff with \'body\' here\n});\n```\n\nDigest authentication is supported, but it only works with `sendImmediately`\nset to `false`; otherwise `request` will send basic authentication on the\ninitial request, which will probably cause the request to fail.\n\nBearer authentication is supported, and is activated when the `bearer` value is\navailable. The value may be either a `String` or a `Function` returning a\n`String`. Using a function to supply the bearer token is particularly useful if\nused in conjuction with `defaults` to allow a single function to supply the\nlast known token at the time of sending a request, or to compute one on the fly.\n\n[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n\n---\n\n\n## Custom HTTP Headers\n\nHTTP Headers, such as `User-Agent`, can be set in the `options` object.\nIn the example below, we call the github API to find out the number\nof stars and forks for the request repository. This requires a\ncustom `User-Agent` header as well as https.\n\n```js\nvar request = require(\'request\');\n\nvar options = {\n  url: \'https://api.github.com/repos/request/request\',\n  headers: {\n    \'User-Agent\': \'request\'\n  }\n};\n\nfunction callback(error, response, body) {\n  if (!error && response.statusCode == 200) {\n    var info = JSON.parse(body);\n    console.log(info.stargazers_count + " Stars");\n    console.log(info.forks_count + " Forks");\n  }\n}\n\nrequest(options, callback);\n```\n\n[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n\n---\n\n\n## OAuth Signing\n\n[OAuth version 1.0](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849) is supported.  The\ndefault signing algorithm is\n[HMAC-SHA1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849#section-3.4.2):\n\n```js\n// OAuth1.0 - 3-legged server side flow (Twitter example)\n// step 1\nvar qs = require(\'querystring\')\n  , oauth =\n    { callback: \'http://mysite.com/callback/\'\n    , consumer_key: CONSUMER_KEY\n    , consumer_secret: CONSUMER_SECRET\n    }\n  , url = \'https://api.twitter.com/oauth/request_token\'\n  ;\nrequest.post({url:url, oauth:oauth}, function (e, r, body) {\n  // Ideally, you would take the body in the response\n  // and construct a URL that a user clicks on (like a sign in button).\n  // The verifier is only available in the response after a user has\n  // verified with twitter that they are authorizing your app.\n\n  // step 2\n  var req_data = qs.parse(body)\n  var uri = \'https://api.twitter.com/oauth/authenticate\'\n    + \'?\' + qs.stringify({oauth_token: req_data.oauth_token})\n  // redirect the user to the authorize uri\n\n  // step 3\n  // after the user is redirected back to your server\n  var auth_data = qs.parse(body)\n    , oauth =\n      { consumer_key: CONSUMER_KEY\n      , consumer_secret: CONSUMER_SECRET\n      , token: auth_data.oauth_token\n      , token_secret: req_data.oauth_token_secret\n      , verifier: auth_data.oauth_verifier\n      }\n    , url = \'https://api.twitter.com/oauth/access_token\'\n    ;\n  request.post({url:url, oauth:oauth}, function (e, r, body) {\n    // ready to make signed requests on behalf of the user\n    var perm_data = qs.parse(body)\n      , oauth =\n        { consumer_key: CONSUMER_KEY\n        , consumer_secret: CONSUMER_SECRET\n        , token: perm_data.oauth_token\n        , token_secret: perm_data.oauth_token_secret\n        }\n      , url = \'https://api.twitter.com/1.1/users/show.json\'\n      , qs =\n        { screen_name: perm_data.screen_name\n        , user_id: perm_data.user_id\n        }\n      ;\n    request.get({url:url, oauth:oauth, json:true}, function (e, r, user) {\n      console.log(user)\n    })\n  })\n})\n```\n\nFor [RSA-SHA1 signing](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849#section-3.4.3), make\nthe following changes to the OAuth options object:\n* Pass `signature_method : \'RSA-SHA1\'`\n* Instead of `consumer_secret`, specify a `private_key` string in\n  [PEM format](http://how2ssl.com/articles/working_with_pem_files/)\n\nFor [PLAINTEXT signing](http://oauth.net/core/1.0/#anchor22), make\nthe following changes to the OAuth options object:\n* Pass `signature_method : \'PLAINTEXT\'`\n\nTo send OAuth parameters via query params or in a post body as described in The\n[Consumer Request Parameters](http://oauth.net/core/1.0/#consumer_req_param)\nsection of the oauth1 spec:\n* Pass `transport_method : \'query\'` or `transport_method : \'body\'` in the OAuth\n  options object.\n* `transport_method` defaults to `\'header\'`\n\n[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n\n---\n\n\n## Proxies\n\nIf you specify a `proxy` option, then the request (and any subsequent\nredirects) will be sent via a connection to the proxy server.\n\nIf your endpoint is an `https` url, and you are using a proxy, then\nrequest will send a `CONNECT` request to the proxy server *first*, and\nthen use the supplied connection to connect to the endpoint.\n\nThat is, first it will make a request like:\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 CONNECT endpoint-server.com:80\nHost: proxy-server.com\nUser-Agent: whatever user agent you specify\n```\n\nand then the proxy server make a TCP connection to `endpoint-server`\non port `80`, and return a response that looks like:\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\n```\n\nAt this point, the connection is left open, and the client is\ncommunicating directly with the `endpoint-server.com` machine.\n\nSee [the wikipedia page on HTTP Tunneling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_tunnel)\nfor more information.\n\nBy default, when proxying `http` traffic, request will simply make a\nstandard proxied `http` request.  This is done by making the `url`\nsection of the initial line of the request a fully qualified url to\nthe endpoint.\n\nFor example, it will make a single request that looks like:\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 GET http://endpoint-server.com/some-url\nHost: proxy-server.com\nOther-Headers: all go here\n\nrequest body or whatever\n```\n\nBecause a pure "http over http" tunnel offers no additional security\nor other features, it is generally simpler to go with a\nstraightforward HTTP proxy in this case.  However, if you would like\nto force a tunneling proxy, you may set the `tunnel` option to `true`.\n\nYou can also make a standard proxied `http` request by explicitly setting\n`tunnel : false`, but **note that this will allow the proxy to see the traffic\nto/from the destination server**.\n\nIf you are using a tunneling proxy, you may set the\n`proxyHeaderWhiteList` to share certain headers with the proxy.\n\nYou can also set the `proxyHeaderExclusiveList` to share certain\nheaders only with the proxy and not with destination host.\n\nBy default, this set is:\n\n```\naccept\naccept-charset\naccept-encoding\naccept-language\naccept-ranges\ncache-control\ncontent-encoding\ncontent-language\ncontent-length\ncontent-location\ncontent-md5\ncontent-range\ncontent-type\nconnection\ndate\nexpect\nmax-forwards\npragma\nproxy-authorization\nreferer\nte\ntransfer-encoding\nuser-agent\nvia\n```\n\nNote that, when using a tunneling proxy, the `proxy-authorization`\nheader and any headers from custom `proxyHeaderExclusiveList` are\n*never* sent to the endpoint server, but only to the proxy server.\n\n\n### Controlling proxy behaviour using environment variables\n\nThe following environment variables are respected by `request`:\n\n * `HTTP_PROXY` / `http_proxy`\n * `HTTPS_PROXY` / `https_proxy`\n * `NO_PROXY` / `no_proxy`\n\nWhen `HTTP_PROXY` / `http_proxy` are set, they will be used to proxy non-SSL requests that do not have an explicit `proxy` configuration option present. Similarly, `HTTPS_PROXY` / `https_proxy` will be respected for SSL requests that do not have an explicit `proxy` configuration option. It is valid to define a proxy in one of the environment variables, but then override it for a specific request, using the `proxy` configuration option. Furthermore, the `proxy` configuration option can be explicitly set to false / null to opt out of proxying altogether for that request.\n\n`request` is also aware of the `NO_PROXY`/`no_proxy` environment variables. These variables provide a granular way to opt out of proxying, on a per-host basis. It should contain a comma separated list of hosts to opt out of proxying. It is also possible to opt of proxying when a particular destination port is used. Finally, the variable may be set to `*` to opt out of the implicit proxy configuration of the other environment variables.\n\nHere\'s some examples of valid `no_proxy` values:\n\n * `google.com` - don\'t proxy HTTP/HTTPS requests to Google.\n * `google.com:443` - don\'t proxy HTTPS requests to Google, but *do* proxy HTTP requests to Google.\n * `google.com:443, yahoo.com:80` - don\'t proxy HTTPS requests to Google, and don\'t proxy HTTP requests to Yahoo!\n * `*` - ignore `https_proxy`/`http_proxy` environment variables altogether.\n\n[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n\n---\n\n\n## UNIX Domain Sockets\n\n`request` supports making requests to [UNIX Domain Sockets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_domain_socket). To make one, use the following URL scheme:\n\n```js\n/* Pattern */ \'http://unix:SOCKET:PATH\'\n/* Example */ request.get(\'http://unix:/absolute/path/to/unix.socket:/request/path\')\n```\n\nNote: The `SOCKET` path is assumed to be absolute to the root of the host file system.\n\n[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n\n---\n\n\n## TLS/SSL Protocol\n\nTLS/SSL Protocol options, such as `cert`, `key` and `passphrase`, can be\nset in the `agentOptions` property of the `options` object.\nIn the example below, we call an API requires client side SSL certificate\n(in PEM format) with passphrase protected private key (in PEM format) and disable the SSLv3 protocol:\n\n```js\nvar fs = require(\'fs\')\n    , path = require(\'path\')\n    , certFile = path.resolve(__dirname, \'ssl/client.crt\')\n    , keyFile = path.resolve(__dirname, \'ssl/client.key\')\n    , request = require(\'request\');\n\nvar options = {\n    url: \'https://api.some-server.com/\',\n    agentOptions: {\n        cert: fs.readFileSync(certFile),\n        key: fs.readFileSync(keyFile),\n        // Or use `pfx` property replacing `cert` and `key` when using private key, certificate and CA certs in PFX or PKCS12 format:\n        // pfx: fs.readFileSync(pfxFilePath),\n        passphrase: \'password\',\n        securityOptions: \'SSL_OP_NO_SSLv3\'\n    }\n};\n\nrequest.get(options);\n```\n\nIt is able to force using SSLv3 only by specifying `secureProtocol`:\n\n```js\nrequest.get({\n    url: \'https://api.some-server.com/\',\n    agentOptions: {\n        secureProtocol: \'SSLv3_method\'\n    }\n});\n```\n\nIt is possible to accept other certificates than those signed by generally allowed Certificate Authorities (CAs).\nThis can be useful, for example,  when using self-signed certificates.\nTo allow a different certificate, you can specify the signing CA by adding the contents of the CA\'s certificate file to the `agentOptions`:\n\n```js\nrequest.get({\n    url: \'https://api.some-server.com/\',\n    agentOptions: {\n        ca: fs.readFileSync(\'ca.cert.pem\')\n    }\n});\n```\n\n[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n\n---\n\n## Support for HAR 1.2\n\nThe `options.har` property will override the values: `url`, `method`, `qs`, `headers`, `form`, `formData`, `body`, `json`, as well as construct multipart data and read files from disk when `request.postData.params[].fileName` is present without a matching `value`.\n\na validation step will check if the HAR Request format matches the latest spec (v1.2) and will skip parsing if not matching.\n\n```js\n  var request = require(\'request\')\n  request({\n    // will be ignored\n    method: \'GET\'\n    uri: \'http://www.google.com\',\n\n    // HTTP Archive Request Object\n    har: {\n      url: \'http://www.mockbin.com/har\'\n      method: \'POST\',\n      headers: [\n        {\n          name: \'content-type\',\n          value: \'application/x-www-form-urlencoded\'\n        }\n      ],\n      postData: {\n        mimeType: \'application/x-www-form-urlencoded\',\n        params: [\n          {\n            name: \'foo\',\n            value: \'bar\'\n          },\n          {\n            name: \'hello\',\n            value: \'world\'\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  })\n\n  // a POST request will be sent to http://www.mockbin.com\n  // with body an application/x-www-form-urlencoded body:\n  // foo=bar&hello=world\n```\n\n[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n\n---\n\n## request(options, callback)\n\nThe first argument can be either a `url` or an `options` object. The only required option is `uri`; all others are optional.\n\n- `uri` || `url` - fully qualified uri or a parsed url object from `url.parse()`\n- `baseUrl` - fully qualified uri string used as the base url. Most useful with `request.defaults`, for example when you want to do many requests to the same domain.  If `baseUrl` is `https://example.com/api/`, then requesting `/end/point?test=true` will fetch `https://example.com/api/end/point?test=true`. When `baseUrl` is given, `uri` must also be a string.\n- `method` - http method (default: `"GET"`)\n- `headers` - http headers (default: `{}`)\n\n---\n\n- `qs` - object containing querystring values to be appended to the `uri`\n- `qsParseOptions` - object containing options to pass to the [qs.parse](https://github.com/hapijs/qs#parsing-objects) method or [querystring.parse](https://nodejs.org/docs/v0.12.0/api/querystring.html#querystring_querystring_parse_str_sep_eq_options) method\n- `qsStringifyOptions` - object containing options to pass to the [qs.stringify](https://github.com/hapijs/qs#stringifying) method or to the [querystring.stringify](https://nodejs.org/docs/v0.12.0/api/querystring.html#querystring_querystring_stringify_obj_sep_eq_options) method. For example, to change the way arrays are converted to query strings pass the `arrayFormat` option with one of `indices|brackets|repeat`\n- `useQuerystring` - If true, use `querystring` to stringify and parse\n  querystrings, otherwise use `qs` (default: `false`).  Set this option to\n  `true` if you need arrays to be serialized as `foo=bar&foo=baz` instead of the\n  default `foo[0]=bar&foo[1]=baz`.\n\n---\n\n- `body` - entity body for PATCH, POST and PUT requests. Must be a `Buffer` or `String`, unless `json` is `true`. If `json` is `true`, then `body` must be a JSON-serializable object.\n- `form` - when passed an object or a querystring, this sets `body` to a querystring representation of value, and adds `Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded` header. When passed no options, a `FormData` instance is returned (and is piped to request). See "Forms" section above.\n- `formData` - Data to pass for a `multipart/form-data` request. See\n  [Forms](#forms) section above.\n- `multipart` - array of objects which contain their own headers and `body`\n  attributes. Sends a `multipart/related` request. See [Forms](#forms) section\n  above.\n  - Alternatively you can pass in an object `{chunked: false, data: []}` where\n    `chunked` is used to specify whether the request is sent in\n    [chunked transfer encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunked_transfer_encoding)\n    In non-chunked requests, data items with body streams are not allowed.\n- `preambleCRLF` - append a newline/CRLF before the boundary of your `multipart/form-data` request.\n- `postambleCRLF` - append a newline/CRLF at the end of the boundary of your `multipart/form-data` request.\n- `json` - sets `body` but to JSON representation of value and adds `Content-type: application/json` header.  Additionally, parses the response body as JSON.\n- `jsonReviver` - a [reviver function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse) that will be passed to `JSON.parse()` when parsing a JSON response body.\n\n---\n\n- `auth` - A hash containing values `user` || `username`, `pass` || `password`, and `sendImmediately` (optional).  See documentation above.\n- `oauth` - Options for OAuth HMAC-SHA1 signing. See documentation above.\n- `hawk` - Options for [Hawk signing](https://github.com/hueniverse/hawk). The `credentials` key must contain the necessary signing info, [see hawk docs for details](https://github.com/hueniverse/hawk#usage-example).\n- `aws` - `object` containing AWS signing information. Should have the properties `key`, `secret`. Also requires the property `bucket`, unless you’re specifying your `bucket` as part of the path, or the request doesn’t use a bucket (i.e. GET Services)\n- `httpSignature` - Options for the [HTTP Signature Scheme](https://github.com/joyent/node-http-signature/blob/master/http_signing.md) using [Joyent\'s library](https://github.com/joyent/node-http-signature). The `keyId` and `key` properties must be specified. See the docs for other options.\n\n---\n\n- `followRedirect` - follow HTTP 3xx responses as redirects (default: `true`). This property can also be implemented as function which gets `response` object as a single argument and should return `true` if redirects should continue or `false` otherwise.\n- `followAllRedirects` - follow non-GET HTTP 3xx responses as redirects (default: `false`)\n- `maxRedirects` - the maximum number of redirects to follow (default: `10`)\n\n---\n\n- `encoding` - Encoding to be used on `setEncoding` of response data. If `null`, the `body` is returned as a `Buffer`. Anything else **(including the default value of `undefined`)** will be passed as the [encoding](http://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer_buffer) parameter to `toString()` (meaning this is effectively `utf8` by default).\n- `gzip` - If `true`, add an `Accept-Encoding` header to request compressed content encodings from the server (if not already present) and decode supported content encodings in the response.  **Note:** Automatic decoding of the response content is performed on the body data returned through `request` (both through the `request` stream and passed to the callback function) but is not performed on the `response` stream (available from the `response` event) which is the unmodified `http.IncomingMessage` object which may contain compressed data. See example below.\n- `jar` - If `true` and `tough-cookie` is installed, remember cookies for future use (or define your custom cookie jar; see examples section)\n\n---\n\n- `pool` - An object describing which agents to use for the request. If this option is omitted the request will use the global agent (as long as [your options allow for it](request.js#L747)). Otherwise, request will search the pool for your custom agent. If no custom agent is found, a new agent will be created and added to the pool.\n  - A `maxSockets` property can also be provided on the `pool` object to set the max number of sockets for all agents created (ex: `pool: {maxSockets: Infinity}`).\n  - Note that if you are sending multiple requests in a loop and creating\n    multiple new `pool` objects, `maxSockets` will not work as intended.  To\n    work around this, either use [`request.defaults`](#requestdefaultsoptions)\n    with your pool options or create the pool object with the `maxSockets`\n    property outside of the loop.\n- `timeout` - Integer containing the number of milliseconds to wait for a\n  request to respond before aborting the request.  Note that if the underlying\n  TCP connection cannot be established, the OS-wide TCP connection timeout will\n  overrule the `timeout` option ([the default in Linux is around 20 seconds](http://www.sekuda.com/overriding_the_default_linux_kernel_20_second_tcp_socket_connect_timeout)).\n- `localAddress` - Local interface to bind for network connections.\n- `proxy` - An HTTP proxy to be used. Supports proxy Auth with Basic Auth, identical to support for the `url` parameter (by embedding the auth info in the `uri`)\n- `strictSSL` - If `true`, requires SSL certificates be valid. **Note:** to use your own certificate authority, you need to specify an agent that was created with that CA as an option.\n- `agentOptions` - Object containing user agent options. See documentation above. **Note:** [see tls API doc for TLS/SSL options](http://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_tls_connect_options_callback).\n- `tunnel` - controls the behavior of\n  [HTTP `CONNECT` tunneling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_tunnel#HTTP_CONNECT_tunneling)\n  as follows:\n   - `undefined` (default) - `true` if the destination is `https` or a previous\n     request in the redirect chain used a tunneling proxy, `false` otherwise\n   - `true` - always tunnel to the destination by making a `CONNECT` request to\n     the proxy\n   - `false` - request the destination as a `GET` request.\n- `proxyHeaderWhiteList` - A whitelist of headers to send to a\n  tunneling proxy.\n- `proxyHeaderExclusiveList` - A whitelist of headers to send\n  exclusively to a tunneling proxy and not to destination.\n- `removeRefererHeader` - removes the referer header when a redirect happens (default: `false`).\n\n---\n\n- `time` - If `true`, the request-response cycle (including all redirects) is timed at millisecond resolution, and the result provided on the response\'s `elapsedTime` property.\n\n---\n\n- `har` - A [HAR 1.2 Request Object](http://www.softwareishard.com/blog/har-12-spec/#request), will be processed from HAR format into options overwriting matching values *(see the [HAR 1.2 section](#support-for-har-1.2) for details)*\n\nThe callback argument gets 3 arguments:\n\n1. An `error` when applicable (usually from [`http.ClientRequest`](http://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_clientrequest) object)\n2. An [`http.IncomingMessage`](http://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_http_incomingmessage) object\n3. The third is the `response` body (`String` or `Buffer`, or JSON object if the `json` option is supplied)\n\n[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n\n---\n\n## Convenience methods\n\nThere are also shorthand methods for different HTTP METHODs and some other conveniences.\n\n\n### request.defaults(options)\n\nThis method **returns a wrapper** around the normal request API that defaults\nto whatever options you pass to it.\n\n**Note:** `request.defaults()` **does not** modify the global request API;\ninstead, it **returns a wrapper** that has your default settings applied to it.\n\n**Note:** You can call `.defaults()` on the wrapper that is returned from\n`request.defaults` to add/override defaults that were previously defaulted.\n\nFor example:\n```js\n//requests using baseRequest() will set the \'x-token\' header\nvar baseRequest = request.defaults({\n  headers: {x-token: \'my-token\'}\n})\n\n//requests using specialRequest() will include the \'x-token\' header set in\n//baseRequest and will also include the \'special\' header\nvar specialRequest = baseRequest.defaults({\n  headers: {special: \'special value\'}\n})\n```\n\n### request.put\n\nSame as `request()`, but defaults to `method: "PUT"`.\n\n```js\nrequest.put(url)\n```\n\n### request.patch\n\nSame as `request()`, but defaults to `method: "PATCH"`.\n\n```js\nrequest.patch(url)\n```\n\n### request.post\n\nSame as `request()`, but defaults to `method: "POST"`.\n\n```js\nrequest.post(url)\n```\n\n### request.head\n\nSame as `request()`, but defaults to `method: "HEAD"`.\n\n```js\nrequest.head(url)\n```\n\n### request.del\n\nSame as `request()`, but defaults to `method: "DELETE"`.\n\n```js\nrequest.del(url)\n```\n\n### request.get\n\nSame as `request()` (for uniformity).\n\n```js\nrequest.get(url)\n```\n### request.cookie\n\nFunction that creates a new cookie.\n\n```js\nrequest.cookie(\'key1=value1\')\n```\n### request.jar()\n\nFunction that creates a new cookie jar.\n\n```js\nrequest.jar()\n```\n\n[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n\n---\n\n\n## Debugging\n\nThere are at least three ways to debug the operation of `request`:\n\n1. Launch the node process like `NODE_DEBUG=request node script.js`\n   (`lib,request,otherlib` works too).\n\n2. Set `require(\'request\').debug = true` at any time (this does the same thing\n   as #1).\n\n3. Use the [request-debug module](https://github.com/nylen/request-debug) to\n   view request and response headers and bodies.\n\n[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n\n\n---\n\n\n## Examples:\n\n```js\n  var request = require(\'request\')\n    , rand = Math.floor(Math.random()*100000000).toString()\n    ;\n  request(\n    { method: \'PUT\'\n    , uri: \'http://mikeal.iriscouch.com/testjs/\' + rand\n    , multipart:\n      [ { \'content-type\': \'application/json\'\n        ,  body: JSON.stringify({foo: \'bar\', _attachments: {\'message.txt\': {follows: true, length: 18, \'content_type\': \'text/plain\' }}})\n        }\n      , { body: \'I am an attachment\' }\n      ]\n    }\n  , function (error, response, body) {\n      if(response.statusCode == 201){\n        console.log(\'document saved as: http://mikeal.iriscouch.com/testjs/\'+ rand)\n      } else {\n        console.log(\'error: \'+ response.statusCode)\n        console.log(body)\n      }\n    }\n  )\n```\n\nFor backwards-compatibility, response compression is not supported by default.\nTo accept gzip-compressed responses, set the `gzip` option to `true`.  Note\nthat the body data passed through `request` is automatically decompressed\nwhile the response object is unmodified and will contain compressed data if\nthe server sent a compressed response.\n\n```js\n  var request = require(\'request\')\n  request(\n    { method: \'GET\'\n    , uri: \'http://www.google.com\'\n    , gzip: true\n    }\n  , function (error, response, body) {\n      // body is the decompressed response body\n      console.log(\'server encoded the data as: \' + (response.headers[\'content-encoding\'] || \'identity\'))\n      console.log(\'the decoded data is: \' + body)\n    }\n  ).on(\'data\', function(data) {\n    // decompressed data as it is received\n    console.log(\'decoded chunk: \' + data)\n  })\n  .on(\'response\', function(response) {\n    // unmodified http.IncomingMessage object\n    response.on(\'data\', function(data) {\n      // compressed data as it is received\n      console.log(\'received \' + data.length + \' bytes of compressed data\')\n    })\n  })\n```\n\nCookies are disabled by default (else, they would be used in subsequent requests). To enable cookies, set `jar` to `true` (either in `defaults` or `options`) and install `tough-cookie`.\n\n```js\nvar request = request.defaults({jar: true})\nrequest(\'http://www.google.com\', function () {\n  request(\'http://images.google.com\')\n})\n```\n\nTo use a custom cookie jar (instead of `request`’s global cookie jar), set `jar` to an instance of `request.jar()` (either in `defaults` or `options`)\n\n```js\nvar j = request.jar()\nvar request = request.defaults({jar:j})\nrequest(\'http://www.google.com\', function () {\n  request(\'http://images.google.com\')\n})\n```\n\nOR\n\n```js\nvar j = request.jar();\nvar cookie = request.cookie(\'key1=value1\');\nvar url = \'http://www.google.com\';\nj.setCookie(cookie, url);\nrequest({url: url, jar: j}, function () {\n  request(\'http://images.google.com\')\n})\n```\n\nTo use a custom cookie store (such as a\n[`FileCookieStore`](https://github.com/mitsuru/tough-cookie-filestore)\nwhich supports saving to and restoring from JSON files), pass it as a parameter\nto `request.jar()`:\n\n```js\nvar FileCookieStore = require(\'tough-cookie-filestore\');\n// NOTE - currently the \'cookies.json\' file must already exist!\nvar j = request.jar(new FileCookieStore(\'cookies.json\'));\nrequest = request.defaults({ jar : j })\nrequest(\'http://www.google.com\', function() {\n  request(\'http://images.google.com\')\n})\n```\n\nThe cookie store must be a\n[`tough-cookie`](https://github.com/goinstant/tough-cookie)\nstore and it must support synchronous operations; see the\n[`CookieStore` API docs](https://github.com/goinstant/tough-cookie/#cookiestore-api)\nfor details.\n\nTo inspect your cookie jar after a request:\n\n```js\nvar j = request.jar()\nrequest({url: \'http://www.google.com\', jar: j}, function () {\n  var cookie_string = j.getCookieString(uri); // "key1=value1; key2=value2; ..."\n  var cookies = j.getCookies(uri);\n  // [{key: \'key1\', value: \'value1\', domain: "www.google.com", ...}, ...]\n})\n```\n\n[back to top](#table-of-contents)\n',

Yes, I said robots. That world is here and now with node-serialport. It provides a very simple interface to the low level serial port code necessary to program [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/) chipsets, [X10](http://www.smarthome.com/manuals/protocol.txt) wireless communications, or even the rising [Z-Wave](http://www.z-wave.com/modules/ZwaveStart/) and [Zigbee](http://www.zigbee.org/) standards. The physical world is your oyster with this goodie. For a full break down of why we made this, please read [NodeBots - The Rise of JS Robotics](http://www.voodootikigod.com/nodebots-the-rise-of-js-robotics).\n\n*****\n\nRobots, you say?\n================\n\nThis library is admittedly a base level toolkit for building amazing things with real world (including robots). Here are a couple of those amazing things that leverage node-serialport:\n\n* [Johnny-Five](https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five) - JavaScript IoT and Robotics programming framework.\n* [Cylon.js](http://cylonjs.com/) - JavaScript Robotics, By Your Command.\n* [node-l8smartlight](http://jakobwesthoff.github.io/node-l8smartlight/) ([source](https://github.com/jakobwesthoff/node-l8smartlight)) A node library to control the L8 Smartlight via Bluetooth or USB port\n* [firmata](https://github.com/jgautier/firmata) Talk natively to Arduino using the firmata protocol.\n* [tmpad](http://tmpvar.com/project/tmpad/) [source](https://github.com/tmpvar/tmpad) - a DIY midi pad using infrared, arduino, and nodejs. [Video](http://vimeo.com/34575470)\n* [duino](https://github.com/ecto/duino) - A higher level framework for working with Arduinos in node.js.\n* [Arduino Drinking Game Extravaganza](http://jsconf.eu/2011/arduino_drinking_game_extravaganza.html) - AKA "The Russian" a hexidecimal drinking game for geeks by Uxebu presented at JSConf EU 2011.\n* [Arduino controlling popcorn.js](https://gist.github.com/968773) - Controlling a popcorn.js video with an Arduino kit.\n* [Robotic JavaScript](http://jsconf.eu/2010/speaker/livingroombindmotion_function.html) - The first live presentation of the node-serialport code set as presented at JSConf EU 2010.\n* [devicestack](https://github.com/adrai/devicestack) - This module helps you to represent a device and its protocol.\n* [reflecta](https://github.com/JayBeavers/Reflecta) A communication protocol that combines Arduino Libraries and NodeJS into an integrated system.\n* [rc4pt-node](https://github.com/comsolid/rc4pt-node) - Control Popcorntime with an Infrared receiver and Arduino.\n\nFor getting started with node-serialport, we recommend you begin with the following articles:\n\n* [Arduino Node Security Sensor Hacking](http://nexxylove.tumblr.com/post/20159263403/arduino-node-security-sensor-hacking) - A great all around "how do I use this" article.\n* [NodeBots - The Rise of JS Robotics](http://www.voodootikigod.com/nodebots-the-rise-of-js-robotics) - A survey article of why one would want to program robots in JS.\n* [Johnny-Five Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/rwldrn/johnny-five#setup-and-assemble-arduino) - Introduction to using the high level Johnny-Five library (awesome).\n\nHow To Use\n==========\n\nUsing node-serialport is pretty easy because it is pretty basic. It provides you with the building block to make great things, it is not a complete solution - just a cog in the (world domination) machine.\n\n**Special Notes**\n\n* Support for Node.js version 0.8.x has been removed. Version 1.4.0 is the last version that supported node.js version 0.8.x.\n* Currently support for Node.js version 0.11.x is dealing with an issue in the latest version of v. 0.11.13. We have confirmed things are fine with 0.11.10 and earlier, but not 0.11.11+.\n\nGood luck.\n\n\nTo Install\n----------\n\nFor most "standard" use cases (node v0.10.x on mac, linux, windows on a x86 or x64 processor), node-serialport will install nice and easy with a simple\n\n```\nnpm install serialport\n```\n\nWe are using [node-pre-gyp](https://github.com/mapbox/node-pre-gyp) to compile and post binaries of the library for most common use cases (linux, mac, windows on standard processor platforms). If you are on a special case, node-serialport will work, but it will compile the binary when you install. Follow the instructions below for how that works.\n\n### Installation Special Cases\n\n\nThis assumes you have everything on your system necessary to compile ANY native module for Node.js. This may not be the case, though, so please ensure the following are true for your system before filing an issue about "Does not install". For all operatings systems, please ensure you have Python 2.x installed AND not 3.0, node-gyp (what we use to compile) requires Python 2.x.\n\n#### Windows:\n\n * Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 are supported.\n * Install [Visual Studio Express 2013 for Windows Desktop](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/2013-downloads#d-2013-express).\n * If you are hacking on an Arduino, be sure to install [the drivers](http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/windows#toc4).\n * Install [node.js 0.10.x](http://nodejs.org/) matching the bitness (32 or 64) of your operating system.\n * Install [Python 2.7.6](http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.6/) matching the bitness of your operating system.  For any questions, please refer to their [FAQ](http://docs.python.org/2/faq/windows.html). Default settings are perfect.\n * Open the \'Visual Studio Command Prompt\' and add Python to the path.\n\n#### Mac OS X:\n\nEnsure that you have at a minimum the xCode Command Line Tools installed appropriate for your system configuration. If you recently upgraded the OS, it probably removed your installation of Command Line Tools, please verify before submitting a ticket.\n\n#### Desktop (Debian/Ubuntu) Linux:\n\nYou know what you need for you system, basically your appropriate analog of build-essential. Keep rocking! Ubuntu renamed the `node` binary `nodejs` which can cause problems building `node-serialport`. The fix is simple, install the [nodejs-legacy package](https://packages.debian.org/sid/nodejs-legacy) that symlinks `/usr/bin/nodejs => /usr/bin/node` or install the more up to date nodejs package from [Chris Lea\'s PPA](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager#ubuntu-mint-elementary-os).\n\n\n```\n# Ubuntu node\nsudo apt-get install nodejs nodejs-legacy\n\n# Or Chris Lea\'s PPA Node (more up to date)\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:chris-lea/node.js\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nodejs\n\nsudo apt-get install build-essential\nnpm install serialport\n```\n\n#### Raspberry Pi Linux:\n\n * Starting with a a vanilla New Out of the Box Software (NOOBS) Raspbian image (currently tested: 5/25/2013)\n * Log into your Raspberry Pi through whatever means works best and ensure you are on a terminal prompt for the remaining steps. This could be local or through an SSH (or a serial connection if you like).\n * Issue the following commands to ensure you are up to date:\n\n```bash\n   sudo apt-get update\n   sudo apt-get upgrade -y\n```\n\n * Download and install node.js:\n\n```bash\n   wget http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.10.12/node-v0.10.12-linux-arm-pi.tar.gz\n   tar xvfz node-v0.10.12-linux-arm-pi.tar.gz\n   sudo mv node-v0.10.12-linux-arm-pi /opt/node/\n```\n\n * Set up your paths correctly:\n\n```bash\n   echo \'export PATH="$PATH:/opt/node/bin"\' >> ~/.bashrc\n   source ~/.bashrc\n```\n\n * Install using npm, note this will take a while as it is actually compiling code and that ARM processor is getting a workout.\n\n```bash\n   npm install serialport\n```\n\nTo Use\n------\n\nOpening a serial port:\n\n```js\nvar SerialPort = require("serialport").SerialPort\nvar serialPort = new SerialPort("/dev/tty-usbserial1", {\n  baudrate: 57600\n});\n```\n\nWhen opening a serial port, you can specify (in this order).\n\n1. Path to Serial Port - required.\n1. Options - optional and described below.\n\nThe options object allows you to pass named options to the serial port during initialization. The valid attributes for the options object are the following:\n\n* baudrate: Baud Rate, defaults to 9600. Should be one of: 115200, 57600, 38400, 19200, 9600, 4800, 2400, 1800, 1200, 600, 300, 200, 150, 134, 110, 75, or 50. Custom rates as allowed by hardware is supported.\n* databits: Data Bits, defaults to 8. Must be one of: 8, 7, 6, or 5.\n* stopbits: Stop Bits, defaults to 1. Must be one of: 1 or 2.\n* parity: Parity, defaults to \'none\'. Must be one of: \'none\', \'even\', \'mark\', \'odd\', \'space\'\n* buffersize: Size of read buffer, defaults to 255. Must be an integer value.\n* parser: The parser engine to use with read data, defaults to rawPacket strategy which just emits the raw buffer as a "data" event. Can be any function that accepts EventEmitter as first parameter and the raw buffer as the second parameter.\n\n**Note, we have added support for either all lowercase OR camelcase of the options (thanks @jagautier), use whichever style you prefer.**\n\nopen event\n----------\n\nYou MUST wait for the open event to be emitted before reading/writing to the serial port. The open happens asynchronously so installing \'data\' listeners and writing\nbefore the open event might result in... nothing at all.\n\nAssuming you are connected to a serial console, you would for example:\n\n```js\nserialPort.on("open", function () {\n  console.log(\'open\');\n  serialPort.on(\'data\', function(data) {\n    console.log(\'data received: \' + data);\n  });\n  serialPort.write("ls\\n", function(err, results) {\n    console.log(\'err \' + err);\n    console.log(\'results \' + results);\n  });\n});\n```\n\nYou can also call the open function, in this case instanciate the serialport with an additional flag.\n\n```js\nvar SerialPort = require("serialport").SerialPort\nvar serialPort = new SerialPort("/dev/tty-usbserial1", {\n  baudrate: 57600\n}, false); // this is the openImmediately flag [default is true]\n\nserialPort.open(function (error) {\n  if ( error ) {\n    console.log(\'failed to open: \'+error);\n  } else {\n    console.log(\'open\');\n    serialPort.on(\'data\', function(data) {\n      console.log(\'data received: \' + data);\n    });\n    serialPort.write("ls\\n", function(err, results) {\n      console.log(\'err \' + err);\n      console.log(\'results \' + results);\n    });\n  }\n});\n```\n\nList Ports\n----------\n\nYou can also list the ports along with some metadata as well.\n\n```js\nvar serialPort = require("serialport");\nserialPort.list(function (err, ports) {\n  ports.forEach(function(port) {\n    console.log(port.comName);\n    console.log(port.pnpId);\n    console.log(port.manufacturer);\n  });\n});\n```\n\nParsers\n-------\n\nOut of the box, node-serialport provides two parsers one that simply emits the raw buffer as a data event and the other which provides familiar "readline" style parsing. To use the readline parser, you must provide a delimiter as such:\n\n```js\nvar serialport = require("serialport");\nvar SerialPort = serialport.SerialPort; // localize object constructor\n\nvar sp = new SerialPort("/dev/tty-usbserial1", {\n  parser: serialport.parsers.readline("\\n")\n});\n```\n\nTo use the raw parser, you just provide the function definition (or leave undefined):\n\n```js\nvar serialport = require("serialport");\nvar SerialPort = serialport.SerialPort; // localize object constructor\n\nvar sp = new SerialPort("/dev/tty-usbserial1", {\n  parser: serialport.parsers.raw\n});\n```\n\n\nYou can get updates of new data from the Serial Port as follows:\n\n```js\nserialPort.on("data", function (data) {\n  sys.puts("here: "+data);\n});\n```\n\nYou can write to the serial port by sending a string or buffer to the write method as follows:\n\n```js\nserialPort.write("OMG IT WORKS\\r");\n```\n\nEnjoy and do cool things with this code.\n\nReference Guide\n---------------\n\n## Methods\n\n### SerialPort (path, options, openImmediately, callback)\n\nCreate a new serial port on `path`.\n\n**_path_**\n\nThe system path of the serial port to open. For example, `/dev/tty` on Mac/Linux or `COM1` on Windows.\n\n**_options (optional)_**\n\nPort configuration options.\n\n* `baudRate`\n* `dataBits`\n* `stopBits`\n* `parity`\n* `rtscts`\n* `xon`\n* `xoff`\n* `xany`\n* `flowControl`\n* `bufferSize`\n* `parser`\n* `encoding`\n* `dataCallback`\n* `disconnectedCallback`\n* `platformOptions` - sets platform specific options, see below.\n\n#### Unix Platform Options\n\nAn object with the following properties:\n\n* `vmin` (default: 1) - see [`man termios`](http://linux.die.net/man/3/termios)\n* `vtime` (default: 0) - see [`man termios`](http://linux.die.net/man/3/termios)\n\n**_openImmediately (optional)_**\n\nAttempts to open a connection to the serial port on `process.nextTick`. The default is `true`. Set to `false` to manually call `open()` at a later time, but note you\'ll need to use factory error listener in the case of constructor errors.\n\n**_callback (optional)_**\n\nCalled when a connection has been opened. The callback should be a function that looks like: `function (error) { ... }`\n\n### .open (callback)\n\nOpens a connection to the given serial port.\n\n**_callback (optional)_**\n\nCalled when a connection has been opened. NOTE: Will NOT be called if openImmediately is set to false as open will not be performed. The callback should be a function that looks like: `function (error) { ... }`\n\n### .write (buffer, callback)\n\nWrites data to the given serial port.\n\n**_buffer_**\n\nThe `buffer` parameter accepts a [`Buffer` ](http://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html) object, or a type that is accepted by the `Buffer` constructor (ex. an array of bytes or a string).\n\n**_callback (optional)_**\n\nCalled once the write operation returns. The callback should be a function that looks like: `function (error) { ... }` _Note: The write operation is non-blocking. When it returns, data may still have not actually been written to the serial port. See `drain()`._\n\n### .pause ()\n\nPauses an open connection.\n\n### .resume ()\n\nResumes a paused connection.\n\n### .flush (callback)\n\nFlushes data received but not read. See [`tcflush()`](http://linux.die.net/man/3/tcflush) for Mac/Linux and [`FlushFileBuffers`](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa364439) for Windows.\n\n**_callback (optional)_**\n\nCalled once the flush operation returns. The callback should be a function that looks like: `function (error) { ... }`\n\n### .drain (callback)\n\nWaits until all output data has been transmitted to the serial port. See [`tcdrain()`](http://linux.die.net/man/3/tcdrain) for more information.\n\n**_callback (optional)_**\n\nCalled once the drain operation returns. The callback should be a function that looks like: `function (error) { ... }`\n\n**Example**\n\nWrites `data` and waits until it has finish transmitting to the target serial port before calling the callback.\n\n```\nfunction writeAndDrain (data, callback) {\n  sp.write(data, function () {\n    sp.drain(callback);\n  });\n}\n```\n\n### .close (callback)\n\nCloses an open connection.\n\n**_callback (optional)_**\n\nCalled once a connection is closed. Closing a connection will also remove all event listeners. The callback should be a function that looks like: `function (error) { ... }`\n\n## Events\n\n### .on(\'open\', callback)\n\n### .on(\'data\', callback)\n\n### .on(\'close\', callback)\n\n### .on(\'error\', callback)\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n\n# Credit\n\nA special thanks to [The Hybrid Group](http://hybridgroup.com) for helping create and hosting the precompiled binaries for OSX, Linux, & Windows. This makes installing node-serialport much easier and much simpler for individuals using those platforms. Thank you.\n',

Alternative\nimplementation is a literal copy of standard one located in standalone\nmodule to avoid requiring of `util`. It also has a shim for old\nbrowsers with no `Object.create` support.\n\nWhile keeping you sure you are using standard `inherits`\nimplementation in node.js environment, it allows bundlers such as\n[browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) to not\ninclude full `util` package to your client code if all you need is\njust `inherits` function. It worth, because browser shim for `util`\npackage is large and `inherits` is often the single function you need\nfrom it.\n\nIt\'s recommended to use this package instead of\n`require(\'util\').inherits` for any code that has chances to be used\nnot only in node.js but in browser too.\n\n## usage\n\n```js\nvar inherits = require(\'inherits\');\n// then use exactly as the standard one\n```\n\n## note on version ~1.0\n\nVersion ~1.0 had completely different motivation and is not compatible\nneither with 2.0 nor with standard node.js `inherits`.\n\nIf you are using version ~1.0 and planning to switch to ~2.0, be\ncareful:\n\n* new version uses `super_` instead of `super` for referencing\n  superclass\n* new version overwrites current prototype while old one preserves any\n  existing fields on it\n',

5805 silly resolved     readme: '# minimatch\n\nA minimal matching utility.\n\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/isaacs/minimatch.png)](http://travis-ci.org/isaacs/minimatch)\n\n\nThis is the matching library used internally by npm.\n\nIt works by converting glob expressions into JavaScript `RegExp`\nobjects.\n\n## Usage\n\n```javascript\nvar minimatch = require("minimatch")\n\nminimatch("bar.foo", "*.foo") // true!\nminimatch("bar.foo", "*.bar") // false!\nminimatch("bar.foo", "*.+(bar|foo)", { debug: true }) // true, and noisy!\n```\n\n## Features\n\nSupports these glob features:\n\n* Brace Expansion\n* Extended glob matching\n* "Globstar" `**` matching\n\nSee:\n\n* `man sh`\n* `man bash`\n* `man 3 fnmatch`\n* `man 5 gitignore`\n\n## Minimatch Class\n\nCreate a minimatch object by instanting the `minimatch.Minimatch` class.\n\n```javascript\nvar Minimatch = require("minimatch").Minimatch\nvar mm = new Minimatch(pattern, options)\n```\n\n### Properties\n\n* `pattern` The original pattern the minimatch object represents.\n* `options` The options supplied to the constructor.\n* `set` A 2-dimensional array of regexp or string expressions.\n  Each row in the\n  array corresponds to a brace-expanded pattern.  Each item in the row\n  corresponds to a single path-part.  For example, the pattern\n  `{a,b/c}/d` would expand to a set of patterns like:\n\n        [ [ a, d ]\n        , [ b, c, d ] ]\n\n    If a portion of the pattern doesn\'t have any "magic" in it\n    (that is, it\'s something like `"foo"` rather than `fo*o?`), then it\n    will be left as a string rather than converted to a regular\n    expression.\n\n* `regexp` Created by the `makeRe` method.  A single regular expression\n  expressing the entire pattern.  This is useful in cases where you wish\n  to use the pattern somewhat like `fnmatch(3)` with `FNM_PATH` enabled.\n* `negate` True if the pattern is negated.\n* `comment` True if the pattern is a comment.\n* `empty` True if the pattern is `""`.\n\n### Methods\n\n* `makeRe` Generate the `regexp` member if necessary, and return it.\n  Will return `false` if the pattern is invalid.\n* `match(fname)` Return true if the filename matches the pattern, or\n  false otherwise.\n* `matchOne(fileArray, patternArray, partial)` Take a `/`-split\n  filename, and match it against a single row in the `regExpSet`.  This\n  method is mainly for internal use, but is exposed so that it can be\n  used by a glob-walker that needs to avoid excessive filesystem calls.\n\nAll other methods are internal, and will be called as necessary.\n\n## Functions\n\nThe top-level exported function has a `cache` property, which is an LRU\ncache set to store 100 items.  So, calling these methods repeatedly\nwith the same pattern and options will use the same Minimatch object,\nsaving the cost of parsing it multiple times.\n\n### minimatch(path, pattern, options)\n\nMain export.  Tests a path against the pattern using the options.\n\n```javascript\nvar isJS = minimatch(file, "*.js", { matchBase: true })\n```\n\n### minimatch.filter(pattern, options)\n\nReturns a function that tests its\nsupplied argument, suitable for use with `Array.filter`.  Example:\n\n```javascript\nvar javascripts = fileList.filter(minimatch.filter("*.js", {matchBase: true}))\n```\n\n### minimatch.match(list, pattern, options)\n\nMatch against the list of\nfiles, in the style of fnmatch or glob.  If nothing is matched, and\noptions.nonull is set, then return a list containing the pattern itself.\n\n```javascript\nvar javascripts = minimatch.match(fileList, "*.js", {matchBase: true}))\n```\n\n### minimatch.makeRe(pattern, options)\n\nMake a regular expression object from the pattern.\n\n## Options\n\nAll options are `false` by default.\n\n### debug\n\nDump a ton of stuff to stderr.\n\n### nobrace\n\nDo not expand `{a,b}` and `{1..3}` brace sets.\n\n### noglobstar\n\nDisable `**` matching against multiple folder names.\n\n### dot\n\nAllow patterns to match filenames starting with a period, even if\nthe pattern does not explicitly have a period in that spot.\n\nNote that by default, `a/**/b` will **not** match `a/.d/b`, unless `dot`\nis set.\n\n### noext\n\nDisable "extglob" style patterns like `+(a|b)`.\n\n### nocase\n\nPerform a case-insensitive match.\n\n### nonull\n\nWhen a match is not found by `minimatch.match`, return a list containing\nthe pattern itself if this option is set.  When not set, an empty list\nis returned if there are no matches.\n\n### matchBase\n\nIf set, then patterns without slashes will be matched\nagainst the basename of the path if it contains slashes.  For example,\n`a?b` would match the path `/xyz/123/acb`, but not `/xyz/acb/123`.\n\n### nocomment\n\nSuppress the behavior of treating `#` at the start of a pattern as a\ncomment.\n\n### nonegate\n\nSuppress the behavior of treating a leading `!` character as negation.\n\n### flipNegate\n\nReturns from negate expressions the same as if they were not negated.\n(Ie, true on a hit, false on a miss.)\n\n\n## Comparisons to other fnmatch/glob implementations\n\nWhile strict compliance with the existing standards is a worthwhile\ngoal, some discrepancies exist between minimatch and other\nimplementations, and are intentional.\n\nIf the pattern starts with a `!` character, then it is negated.  Set the\n`nonegate` flag to suppress this behavior, and treat leading `!`\ncharacters normally.  This is perhaps relevant if you wish to start the\npattern with a negative extglob pattern like `!(a|B)`.  Multiple `!`\ncharacters at the start of a pattern will negate the pattern multiple\ntimes.\n\nIf a pattern starts with `#`, then it is treated as a comment, and\nwill not match anything.  Use `\\#` to match a literal `#` at the\nstart of a line, or set the `nocomment` flag to suppress this behavior.\n\nThe double-star character `**` is supported by default, unless the\n`noglobstar` flag is set.  This is supported in the manner of bsdglob\nand bash 4.1, where `**` only has special significance if it is the only\nthing in a path part.  That is, `a/**/b` will match `a/x/y/b`, but\n`a/**b` will not.\n\nIf an escaped pattern has no matches, and the `nonull` flag is set,\nthen minimatch.match returns the pattern as-provided, rather than\ninterpreting the character escapes.  For example,\n`minimatch.match([], "\\\\*a\\\\?")` will return `"\\\\*a\\\\?"` rather than\n`"*a?"`.  This is akin to setting the `nullglob` option in bash, except\nthat it does not resolve escaped pattern characters.\n\nIf brace expansion is not disabled, then it is performed before any\nother interpretation of the glob pattern.  Thus, a pattern like\n`+(a|{b),c)}`, which would not be valid in bash or zsh, is expanded\n**first** into the set of `+(a|b)` and `+(a|c)`, and those patterns are\nchecked for validity.  Since those two are valid, matching proceeds.\n',

The last\nis an argument that\'s only used when the object has been seen already.\n\nThe default `decycler` function returns the string `\'[Circular]\'`.\nIf, for example, you pass in `function(k,v){}` (return nothing) then it\nwill prune cycles.  If you pass in `function(k,v){ return {foo: \'bar\'}}`,\nthen cyclical objects will always be represented as `{"foo":"bar"}` in\nthe result.\n\n```\nstringify.getSerialize(serializer, decycler)\n```\n\nReturns a serializer that can be used elsewhere.  This is the actual\nfunction that\'s passed to JSON.stringify.\n',

Can be used to submit forms and file uploads to other web applications.\n\nThe API of this module is inspired by the [XMLHttpRequest-2 FormData Interface][xhr2-fd].\n\n[xhr2-fd]: http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/XMLHttpRequest-2/Overview.html#the-formdata-interface\n[streams2-thing]: http://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_compatibility_with_older_node_versions\n\n## Install\n\n```\nnpm install form-data\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nIn this example we are constructing a form with 3 fields that contain a string,\na buffer and a file stream.\n\n``` javascript\nvar FormData = require(\'form-data\');\nvar fs = require(\'fs\');\n\nvar form = new FormData();\nform.append(\'my_field\', \'my value\');\nform.append(\'my_buffer\', new Buffer(10));\nform.append(\'my_file\', fs.createReadStream(\'/foo/bar.jpg\'));\n```\n\nAlso you can use http-response stream:\n\n``` javascript\nvar FormData = require(\'form-data\');\nvar http = require(\'http\');\n\nvar form = new FormData();\n\nhttp.request(\'http://nodejs.org/images/logo.png\', function(response) {\n  form.append(\'my_field\', \'my value\');\n  form.append(\'my_buffer\', new Buffer(10));\n  form.append(\'my_logo\', response);\n});\n```\n\nOr @mikeal\'s request stream:\n\n``` javascript\nvar FormData = require(\'form-data\');\nvar request = require(\'request\');\n\nvar form = new FormData();\n\nform.append(\'my_field\', \'my value\');\nform.append(\'my_buffer\', new Buffer(10));\nform.append(\'my_logo\', request(\'http://nodejs.org/images/logo.png\'));\n```\n\nIn order to submit this form to a web application, call ```submit(url, [callback])``` method:\n\n``` javascript\nform.submit(\'http://example.org/\', function(err, res) {\n  // res – response object (http.IncomingMessage)  //\n  res.resume(); // for node-0.10.x\n});\n\n```\n\nFor more advanced request manipulations ```submit()``` method returns ```http.ClientRequest``` object, or you can choose from one of the alternative submission methods.\n\n### Alternative submission methods\n\nYou can use node\'s http client interface:\n\n``` javascript\nvar http = require(\'http\');\n\nvar request = http.request({\n  method: \'post\',\n  host: \'example.org\',\n  path: \'/upload\',\n  headers: form.getHeaders()\n});\n\nform.pipe(request);\n\nrequest.on(\'response\', function(res) {\n  console.log(res.statusCode);\n});\n```\n\nOr if you would prefer the `\'Content-Length\'` header to be set for you:\n\n``` javascript\nform.submit(\'example.org/upload\', function(err, res) {\n  console.log(res.statusCode);\n});\n```\n\nTo use custom headers and pre-known length in parts:\n\n``` javascript\nvar CRLF = \'\\r\\n\';\nvar form = new FormData();\n\nvar options = {\n  header: CRLF + \'--\' + form.getBoundary() + CRLF + \'X-Custom-Header: 123\' + CRLF + CRLF,\n  knownLength: 1\n};\n\nform.append(\'my_buffer\', buffer, options);\n\nform.submit(\'http://example.com/\', function(err, res) {\n  if (err) throw err;\n  console.log(\'Done\');\n});\n```\n\nForm-Data can recognize and fetch all the required information from common types of streams (```fs.readStream```, ```http.response``` and ```mikeal\'s request```), for some other types of streams you\'d need to provide "file"-related information manually:\n\n``` javascript\nsomeModule.stream(function(err, stdout, stderr) {\n  if (err) throw err;\n\n  var form = new FormData();\n\n  form.append(\'file\', stdout, {\n    filename: \'unicycle.jpg\',\n    contentType: \'image/jpg\',\n    knownLength: 19806\n  });\n\n  form.submit(\'http://example.com/\', function(err, res) {\n    if (err) throw err;\n    console.log(\'Done\');\n  });\n});\n```\n\nFor edge cases, like POST request to URL with query string or to pass HTTP auth credentials, object can be passed to `form.submit()` as first parameter:\n\n``` javascript\nform.submit({\n  host: \'example.com\',\n  path: \'/probably.php?extra=params\',\n  auth: \'username:password\'\n}, function(err, res) {\n  console.log(res.statusCode);\n});\n```\n\nIn case you need to also send custom HTTP headers with the POST request, you can use the `headers` key in first parameter of `form.submit()`:\n\n``` javascript\nform.submit({\n  host: \'example.com\',\n  path: \'/surelynot.php\',\n  headers: {\'x-test-header\': \'test-header-value\'}\n}, function(err, res) {\n  console.log(res.statusCode);\n});\n```\n\n## Notes\n\n- ```getLengthSync()``` method DOESN\'T calculate length for streams, use ```knownLength``` options as workaround.\n- If it feels like FormData hangs after submit and you\'re on ```node-0.10```, please check [Compatibility with Older Node Versions][streams2-thing]\n\n## TODO\n\n- Add new streams (0.10) support and try really hard not to break it for 0.8.x.\n\n## License\n\nForm-Data is licensed under the MIT license.\n',

If you don\'t want that to happen, you can set `pauseStreams`\nto `false`:\n\n``` javascript\nvar CombinedStream = require(\'combined-stream\');\nvar fs = require(\'fs\');\n\nvar combinedStream = CombinedStream.create({pauseStreams: false});\ncombinedStream.append(fs.createReadStream(\'file1.txt\'));\ncombinedStream.append(fs.createReadStream(\'file2.txt\'));\n\ncombinedStream.pipe(fs.createWriteStream(\'combined.txt\'));\n```\n\nHowever, what if you don\'t have all the source streams yet, or you don\'t want\nto allocate the resources (file descriptors, memory, etc.) for them right away?\nWell, in that case you can simply provide a callback that supplies the stream\nby calling a `next()` function:\n\n``` javascript\nvar CombinedStream = require(\'combined-stream\');\nvar fs = require(\'fs\');\n\nvar combinedStream = CombinedStream.create();\ncombinedStream.append(function(next) {\n  next(fs.createReadStream(\'file1.txt\'));\n});\ncombinedStream.append(function(next) {\n  next(fs.createReadStream(\'file2.txt\'));\n});\n\ncombinedStream.pipe(fs.createWriteStream(\'combined.txt\'));\n```\n\n## API\n\n### CombinedStream.create([options])\n\nReturns a new combined stream object. Available options are:\n\n* `maxDataSize`\n* `pauseStreams`\n\nThe effect of those options is described below.\n\n### combinedStream.pauseStreams = `true`\n\nWhether to apply back pressure to the underlaying streams. If set to `false`,\nthe underlaying streams will never be paused. If set to `true`, the\nunderlaying streams will be paused right after being appended, as well as when\n`delayedStream.pipe()` wants to throttle.\n\n### combinedStream.maxDataSize = `2 * 1024 * 1024`\n\nThe maximum amount of bytes (or characters) to buffer for all source streams.\nIf this value is exceeded, `combinedStream` emits an `\'error\'` event.\n\n### combinedStream.dataSize = `0`\n\nThe amount of bytes (or characters) currently buffered by `combinedStream`.\n\n### combinedStream.append(stream)\n\nAppends the given `stream` to the combinedStream object. If `pauseStreams` is\nset to `true, this stream will also be paused right away.\n\n`streams` can also be a function that takes one parameter called `next`. `next`\nis a function that must be invoked in order to provide the `next` stream, see\nexample above.\n\nRegardless of how the `stream` is appended, combined-stream always attaches an\n`\'error\'` listener to it, so you don\'t have to do that manually.\n\nSpecial case: `stream` can also be a String or Buffer.\n\n### combinedStream.write(data)\n\nYou should not call this, `combinedStream` takes care of piping the appended\nstreams into itself for you.\n\n### combinedStream.resume()\n\nCauses `combinedStream` to start drain the streams it manages. The function is\nidempotent, and also emits a `\'resume\'` event each time which usually goes to\nthe stream that is currently being drained.\n\n### combinedStream.pause();\n\nIf `combinedStream.pauseStreams` is set to `false`, this does nothing.\nOtherwise a `\'pause\'` event is emitted, this goes to the stream that is\ncurrently being drained, so you can use it to apply back pressure.\n\n### combinedStream.end();\n\nSets `combinedStream.writable` to false, emits an `\'end\'` event, and removes\nall streams from the queue.\n\n### combinedStream.destroy();\n\nSame as `combinedStream.end()`, except it emits a `\'close\'` event instead of\n`\'end\'`.\n\n## License\n\ncombined-stream is licensed under the MIT license.\n',

6617 silly resolved     readme: '## Caseless -- wrap an object to set and get property with caseless semantics but also preserve caseing.\n\nThis library is incredibly useful when working with HTTP headers. It allows you to get/set/check for headers in a caseless manner while also preserving the caseing of headers the first time they are set.\n\n## Usage\n\n```javascript\nvar headers = {}\n  , c = caseless(headers)\n  ;\nc.set(\'a-Header\', \'asdf\')\nc.get(\'a-header\') === \'asdf\'\n```\n\n## has(key)\n\nHas takes a name and if it finds a matching header will return that header name with the preserved caseing it was set with.\n\n```javascript\nc.has(\'a-header\') === \'a-Header\'\n```\n\n## set(key, value[, clobber=true])\n\nSet is fairly straight forward except that if the header exists and clobber is disabled it will add `\',\'+value` to the existing header.\n\n```javascript\nc.set(\'a-Header\', \'fdas\')\nc.set(\'a-HEADER\', \'more\', false)\nc.get(\'a-header\') === \'fdsa,more\'\n```\n\n## swap(key)\n\nSwaps the casing of a header with the new one that is passed in.\n\n```javascript\nvar headers = {}\n  , c = caseless(headers)\n  ;\nc.set(\'a-Header\', \'fdas\')\nc.swap(\'a-HEADER\')\nc.has(\'a-header\') === \'a-HEADER\'\nheaders === {\'a-HEADER\': \'fdas\'}\n```\n',

Check this [crazy shit](https://gist.github.com/982883) out! )\n* [Annotated source code](http://broofa.github.com/node-uuid/docs/uuid.html)\n* Comes with a Command Line Interface for generating uuids on the command line\n\n## Getting Started\n\nInstall it in your browser:\n\n```html\n<script src="uuid.js"></script>\n```\n\nOr in node.js:\n\n```\nnpm install node-uuid\n```\n\n```javascript\nvar uuid = require(\'node-uuid\');\n```\n\nThen create some ids ...\n\n```javascript\n// Generate a v1 (time-based) id\nuuid.v1(); // -> \'6c84fb90-12c4-11e1-840d-7b25c5ee775a\'\n\n// Generate a v4 (random) id\nuuid.v4(); // -> \'110ec58a-a0f2-4ac4-8393-c866d813b8d1\'\n```\n\n## API\n\n### uuid.v1([`options` [, `buffer` [, `offset`]]])\n\nGenerate and return a RFC4122 v1 (timestamp-based) UUID.\n\n* `options` - (Object) Optional uuid state to apply. Properties may include:\n\n  * `node` - (Array) Node id as Array of 6 bytes (per 4.1.6). Default: Randomly generated ID.  See note 1.\n  * `clockseq` - (Number between 0 - 0x3fff) RFC clock sequence.  Default: An internally maintained clockseq is used.\n  * `msecs` - (Number | Date) Time in milliseconds since unix Epoch.  Default: The current time is used.\n  * `nsecs` - (Number between 0-9999) additional time, in 100-nanosecond units. Ignored if `msecs` is unspecified. Default: internal uuid counter is used, as per 4.2.1.2.\n\n* `buffer` - (Array | Buffer) Array or buffer where UUID bytes are to be written.\n* `offset` - (Number) Starting index in `buffer` at which to begin writing.\n\nReturns `buffer`, if specified, otherwise the string form of the UUID\n\nNotes:\n\n1. The randomly generated node id is only guaranteed to stay constant for the lifetime of the current JS runtime. (Future versions of this module may use persistent storage mechanisms to extend this guarantee.)\n\nExample: Generate string UUID with fully-specified options\n\n```javascript\nuuid.v1({\n  node: [0x01, 0x23, 0x45, 0x67, 0x89, 0xab],\n  clockseq: 0x1234,\n  msecs: new Date(\'2011-11-01\').getTime(),\n  nsecs: 5678\n});   // -> "710b962e-041c-11e1-9234-0123456789ab"\n```\n\nExample: In-place generation of two binary IDs\n\n```javascript\n// Generate two ids in an array\nvar arr = new Array(32); // -> []\nuuid.v1(null, arr, 0);   // -> [02 a2 ce 90 14 32 11 e1 85 58 0b 48 8e 4f c1 15]\nuuid.v1(null, arr, 16);  // -> [02 a2 ce 90 14 32 11 e1 85 58 0b 48 8e 4f c1 15 02 a3 1c b0 14 32 11 e1 85 58 0b 48 8e 4f c1 15]\n\n// Optionally use uuid.unparse() to get stringify the ids\nuuid.unparse(buffer);    // -> \'02a2ce90-1432-11e1-8558-0b488e4fc115\'\nuuid.unparse(buffer, 16) // -> \'02a31cb0-1432-11e1-8558-0b488e4fc115\'\n```\n\n### uuid.v4([`options` [, `buffer` [, `offset`]]])\n\nGenerate and return a RFC4122 v4 UUID.\n\n* `options` - (Object) Optional uuid state to apply. Properties may include:\n\n  * `random` - (Number[16]) Array of 16 numbers (0-255) to use in place of randomly generated values\n  * `rng` - (Function) Random # generator to use.  Set to one of the built-in generators - `uuid.mathRNG` (all platforms), `uuid.nodeRNG` (node.js only), `uuid.whatwgRNG` (WebKit only) - or a custom function that returns an array[16] of byte values.\n\n* `buffer` - (Array | Buffer) Array or buffer where UUID bytes are to be written.\n* `offset` - (Number) Starting index in `buffer` at which to begin writing.\n\nReturns `buffer`, if specified, otherwise the string form of the UUID\n\nExample: Generate string UUID with fully-specified options\n\n```javascript\nuuid.v4({\n  random: [\n    0x10, 0x91, 0x56, 0xbe, 0xc4, 0xfb, 0xc1, 0xea,\n    0x71, 0xb4, 0xef, 0xe1, 0x67, 0x1c, 0x58, 0x36\n  ]\n});\n// -> "109156be-c4fb-41ea-b1b4-efe1671c5836"\n```\n\nExample: Generate two IDs in a single buffer\n\n```javascript\nvar buffer = new Array(32); // (or \'new Buffer\' in node.js)\nuuid.v4(null, buffer, 0);\nuuid.v4(null, buffer, 16);\n```\n\n### uuid.parse(id[, buffer[, offset]])\n### uuid.unparse(buffer[, offset])\n\nParse and unparse UUIDs\n\n  * `id` - (String) UUID(-like) string\n  * `buffer` - (Array | Buffer) Array or buffer where UUID bytes are to be written. Default: A new Array or Buffer is used\n  * `offset` - (Number) Starting index in `buffer` at which to begin writing. Default: 0\n\nExample parsing and unparsing a UUID string\n\n```javascript\nvar bytes = uuid.parse(\'797ff043-11eb-11e1-80d6-510998755d10\'); // -> <Buffer 79 7f f0 43 11 eb 11 e1 80 d6 51 09 98 75 5d 10>\nvar string = uuid.unparse(bytes); // -> \'797ff043-11eb-11e1-80d6-510998755d10\'\n```\n\n### uuid.noConflict()\n\n(Browsers only) Set `uuid` property back to it\'s previous value.\n\nReturns the node-uuid object.\n\nExample:\n\n```javascript\nvar myUuid = uuid.noConflict();\nmyUuid.v1(); // -> \'6c84fb90-12c4-11e1-840d-7b25c5ee775a\'\n```\n\n## Deprecated APIs\n\nSupport for the following v1.2 APIs is available in v1.3, but is deprecated and will be removed in the next major version.\n\n### uuid([format [, buffer [, offset]]])\n\nuuid() has become uuid.v4(), and the `format` argument is now implicit in the `buffer` argument. (i.e. if you specify a buffer, the format is assumed to be binary).\n\n### uuid.BufferClass\n\nThe class of container created when generating binary uuid data if no buffer argument is specified.  This is expected to go away, with no replacement API.\n\n## Command Line Interface\n\nTo use the executable, it\'s probably best to install this library globally.\n\n`npm install -g node-uuid`\n\nUsage:\n\n```\nUSAGE: uuid [version] [options]\n\n\noptions:\n\n--help                     Display this message and exit\n```\n\n`version` must be an RFC4122 version that is supported by this library, which is currently version 1 and version 4 (denoted by "v1" and "v4", respectively). `version` defaults to version 4 when not supplied.\n\n### Examples\n\n```\n> uuid\n3a91f950-dec8-4688-ba14-5b7bbfc7a563\n```\n\n```\n> uuid v1\n9d0b43e0-7696-11e3-964b-250efa37a98e\n```\n\n```\n> uuid v4\n6790ac7c-24ac-4f98-8464-42f6d98a53ae\n```\n\n## Testing\n\nIn node.js\n\n```\nnpm test\n```\n\nIn Browser\n\n```\nopen test/test.html\n```\n\n### Benchmarking\n\nRequires node.js\n\n```\nnpm install uuid uuid-js\nnode benchmark/benchmark.js\n```\n\nFor a more complete discussion of node-uuid performance, please see the `benchmark/README.md` file, and the [benchmark wiki](https://github.com/broofa/node-uuid/wiki/Benchmark)\n\nFor browser performance [checkout the JSPerf tests](http://jsperf.com/node-uuid-performance).\n\n## Release notes\n\n### 1.4.0\n\n* Improved module context detection\n* Removed public RNG functions\n\n### 1.3.2\n\n* Improve tests and handling of v1() options (Issue #24)\n* Expose RNG option to allow for perf testing with different generators\n\n### 1.3.0\n\n* Support for version 1 ids, thanks to [@ctavan](https://github.com/ctavan)!\n* Support for node.js crypto API\n* De-emphasizing performance in favor of a) cryptographic quality PRNGs where available and b) more manageable code\n',

6617 silly resolved     readme: '# qs\n\nA querystring parsing and stringifying library with some added security.\n\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/hapijs/qs.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/hapijs/qs)\n\nLead Maintainer: [Nathan LaFreniere](https://github.com/nlf)\n\nThe **qs** module was originally created and maintained by [TJ Holowaychuk](https://github.com/visionmedia/node-querystring).\n\n## Usage\n\n```javascript\nvar Qs = require(\'qs\');\n\nvar obj = Qs.parse(\'a=c\');    // { a: \'c\' }\nvar str = Qs.stringify(obj);  // \'a=c\'\n```\n\n### Parsing Objects\n\n```javascript\nQs.parse(string, [options]);\n```\n\n**qs** allows you to create nested objects within your query strings, by surrounding the name of sub-keys with square brackets `[]`.\nFor example, the string `\'foo[bar]=baz\'` converts to:\n\n```javascript\n{\n  foo: {\n    bar: \'baz\'\n  }\n}\n```\n\nURI encoded strings work too:\n\n```javascript\nQs.parse(\'a%5Bb%5D=c\');\n// { a: { b: \'c\' } }\n```\n\nYou can also nest your objects, like `\'foo[bar][baz]=foobarbaz\'`:\n\n```javascript\n{\n  foo: {\n    bar: {\n      baz: \'foobarbaz\'\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nBy default, when nesting objects **qs** will only parse up to 5 children deep. This means if you attempt to parse a string like\n`\'a[b][c][d][e][f][g][h][i]=j\'` your resulting object will be:\n\n```javascript\n{\n  a: {\n    b: {\n      c: {\n        d: {\n          e: {\n            f: {\n              \'[g][h][i]\': \'j\'\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis depth can be overridden by passing a `depth` option to `Qs.parse(string, [options])`:\n\n```javascript\nQs.parse(\'a[b][c][d][e][f][g][h][i]=j\', { depth: 1 });\n// { a: { b: { \'[c][d][e][f][g][h][i]\': \'j\' } } }\n```\n\nThe depth limit helps mitigate abuse when **qs** is used to parse user input, and it is recommended to keep it a reasonably small number.\n\nFor similar reasons, by default **qs** will only parse up to 1000 parameters. This can be overridden by passing a `parameterLimit` option:\n\n```javascript\nQs.parse(\'a=b&c=d\', { parameterLimit: 1 });\n// { a: \'b\' }\n```\n\nAn optional delimiter can also be passed:\n\n```javascript\nQs.parse(\'a=b;c=d\', { delimiter: \';\' });\n// { a: \'b\', c: \'d\' }\n```\n\nDelimiters can be a regular expression too:\n\n```javascript\nQs.parse(\'a=b;c=d,e=f\', { delimiter: /[;,]/ });\n// { a: \'b\', c: \'d\', e: \'f\' }\n```\n\n### Parsing Arrays\n\n**qs** can also parse arrays using a similar `[]` notation:\n\n```javascript\nQs.parse(\'a[]=b&a[]=c\');\n// { a: [\'b\', \'c\'] }\n```\n\nYou may specify an index as well:\n\n```javascript\nQs.parse(\'a[1]=c&a[0]=b\');\n// { a: [\'b\', \'c\'] }\n```\n\nNote that the only difference between an index in an array and a key in an object is that the value between the brackets must be a number\nto create an array. When creating arrays with specific indices, **qs** will compact a sparse array to only the existing values preserving\ntheir order:\n\n```javascript\nQs.parse(\'a[1]=b&a[15]=c\');\n// { a: [\'b\', \'c\'] }\n```\n\nNote that an empty string is also a value, and will be preserved:\n\n```javascript\nQs.parse(\'a[]=&a[]=b\');\n// { a: [\'\', \'b\'] }\nQs.parse(\'a[0]=b&a[1]=&a[2]=c\');\n// { a: [\'b\', \'\', \'c\'] }\n```\n\n**qs** will also limit specifying indices in an array to a maximum index of `20`. Any array members with an index of greater than `20` will\ninstead be converted to an object with the index as the key:\n\n```javascript\nQs.parse(\'a[100]=b\');\n// { a: { \'100\': \'b\' } }\n```\n\nThis limit can be overridden by passing an `arrayLimit` option:\n\n```javascript\nQs.parse(\'a[1]=b\', { arrayLimit: 0 });\n// { a: { \'1\': \'b\' } }\n```\n\nTo disable array parsing entirely, set `arrayLimit` to `-1`.\n\nIf you mix notations, **qs** will merge the two items into an object:\n\n```javascript\nQs.parse(\'a[0]=b&a[b]=c\');\n// { a: { \'0\': \'b\', b: \'c\' } }\n```\n\nYou can also create arrays of objects:\n\n```javascript\nQs.parse(\'a[][b]=c\');\n// { a: [{ b: \'c\' }] }\n```\n\n### Stringifying\n\n```javascript\nQs.stringify(object, [options]);\n```\n\nWhen stringifying, **qs** always URI encodes output. Objects are stringified as you would expect:\n\n```javascript\nQs.stringify({ a: \'b\' });\n// \'a=b\'\nQs.stringify({ a: { b: \'c\' } });\n// \'a%5Bb%5D=c\'\n```\n\nExamples beyond this point will be shown as though the output is not URI encoded for clarity. Please note that the return values in these cases *will* be URI encoded during real usage.\n\nWhen arrays are stringified, by default they are given explicit indices:\n\n```javascript\nQs.stringify({ a: [\'b\', \'c\', \'d\'] });\n// \'a[0]=b&a[1]=c&a[2]=d\'\n```\n\nYou may override this by setting the `indices` option to `false`:\n\n```javascript\nQs.stringify({ a: [\'b\', \'c\', \'d\'] }, { indices: false });\n// \'a=b&a=c&a=d\'\n```\n\nYou may use the `arrayFormat` option to specify the format of the output array\n\n```javascript\nQs.stringify({ a: [\'b\', \'c\'] }, { arrayFormat: \'indices\' })\n// \'a[0]=b&a[1]=c\'\nQs.stringify({ a: [\'b\', \'c\'] }, { arrayFormat: \'brackets\' })\n// \'a[]=b&a[]=c\'\nQs.stringify({ a: [\'b\', \'c\'] }, { arrayFormat: \'repeat\' })\n// \'a=b&a=c\'\n```\n\nEmpty strings and null values will omit the value, but the equals sign (=) remains in place:\n\n```javascript\nQs.stringify({ a: \'\' });\n// \'a=\'\n```\n\nProperties that are set to `undefined` will be omitted entirely:\n\n```javascript\nQs.stringify({ a: null, b: undefined });\n// \'a=\'\n```\n\nThe delimiter may be overridden with stringify as well:\n\n```javascript\nQs.stringify({ a: \'b\', c: \'d\' }, { delimiter: \';\' });\n// \'a=b;c=d\'\n```\n',

6617 silly resolved     readme: '# bl *(BufferList)*\n\n**A Node.js Buffer list collector, reader and streamer thingy.**\n\n[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/bl.png?downloads=true&downloadRank=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/bl/)\n[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm-dl/bl.png?months=6&height=3)](https://nodei.co/npm/bl/)\n\n**bl** is a storage object for collections of Node Buffers, exposing them with the main Buffer readable API. Also works as a duplex stream so you can collect buffers from a stream that emits them and emit buffers to a stream that consumes them!\n\nThe original buffers are kept intact and copies are only done as necessary. Any reads that require the use of a single original buffer will return a slice of that buffer only (which references the same memory as the original buffer). Reads that span buffers perform concatenation as required and return the results transparently.\n\n```js\nconst BufferList = require(\'bl\')\n\nvar bl = new BufferList()\nbl.append(new Buffer(\'abcd\'))\nbl.append(new Buffer(\'efg\'))\nbl.append(\'hi\')                     // bl will also accept & convert Strings\nbl.append(new Buffer(\'j\'))\nbl.append(new Buffer([ 0x3, 0x4 ]))\n\nconsole.log(bl.length) // 12\n\nconsole.log(bl.slice(0, 10).toString(\'ascii\')) // \'abcdefghij\'\nconsole.log(bl.slice(3, 10).toString(\'ascii\')) // \'defghij\'\nconsole.log(bl.slice(3, 6).toString(\'ascii\'))  // \'def\'\nconsole.log(bl.slice(3, 8).toString(\'ascii\'))  // \'defgh\'\nconsole.log(bl.slice(5, 10).toString(\'ascii\')) // \'fghij\'\n\n// or just use toString!\nconsole.log(bl.toString())               // \'abcdefghij\\u0003\\u0004\'\nconsole.log(bl.toString(\'ascii\', 3, 8))  // \'defgh\'\nconsole.log(bl.toString(\'ascii\', 5, 10)) // \'fghij\'\n\n// other standard Buffer readables\nconsole.log(bl.readUInt16BE(10)) // 0x0304\nconsole.log(bl.readUInt16LE(10)) // 0x0403\n```\n\nGive it a callback in the constructor and use it just like **[concat-stream](https://github.com/maxogden/node-concat-stream)**:\n\n```js\nconst bl = require(\'bl\')\n    , fs = require(\'fs\')\n\nfs.createReadStream(\'README.md\')\n  .pipe(bl(function (err, data) { // note \'new\' isn\'t strictly required\n    // `data` is a complete Buffer object containing the full data\n    console.log(data.toString())\n  }))\n```\n\nNote that when you use the *callback* method like this, the resulting `data` parameter is a concatenation of all `Buffer` objects in the list. If you want to avoid the overhead of this concatenation (in cases of extreme performance consciousness), then avoid the *callback* method and just listen to `\'end\'` instead, like a standard Stream.\n\nOr to fetch a URL using [hyperquest](https://github.com/substack/hyperquest) (should work with [request](http://github.com/mikeal/request) and even plain Node http too!):\n```js\nconst hyperquest = require(\'hyperquest\')\n    , bl         = require(\'bl\')\n    , url        = \'https://raw.github.com/rvagg/bl/master/README.md\'\n\nhyperquest(url).pipe(bl(function (err, data) {\n  console.log(data.toString())\n}))\n```\n\nOr, use it as a readable stream to recompose a list of Buffers to an output source:\n\n```js\nconst BufferList = require(\'bl\')\n    , fs         = require(\'fs\')\n\nvar bl = new BufferList()\nbl.append(new Buffer(\'abcd\'))\nbl.append(new Buffer(\'efg\'))\nbl.append(new Buffer(\'hi\'))\nbl.append(new Buffer(\'j\'))\n\nbl.pipe(fs.createWriteStream(\'gibberish.txt\'))\n```\n\n## API\n\n  * <a href="#ctor"><code><b>new BufferList([ callback ])</b></code></a>\n  * <a href="#length"><code>bl.<b>length</b></code></a>\n  * <a href="#append"><code>bl.<b>append(buffer)</b></code></a>\n  * <a href="#get"><code>bl.<b>get(index)</b></code></a>\n  * <a href="#slice"><code>bl.<b>slice([ start[, end ] ])</b></code></a>\n  * <a href="#copy"><code>bl.<b>copy(dest, [ destStart, [ srcStart [, srcEnd ] ] ])</b></code></a>\n  * <a href="#duplicate"><code>bl.<b>duplicate()</b></code></a>\n  * <a href="#consume"><code>bl.<b>consume(bytes)</b></code></a>\n  * <a href="#toString"><code>bl.<b>toString([encoding, [ start, [ end ]]])</b></code></a>\n  * <a href="#readXX"><code>bl.<b>readDoubleBE()</b></code>, <code>bl.<b>readDoubleLE()</b></code>, <code>bl.<b>readFloatBE()</b></code>, <code>bl.<b>readFloatLE()</b></code>, <code>bl.<b>readInt32BE()</b></code>, <code>bl.<b>readInt32LE()</b></code>, <code>bl.<b>readUInt32BE()</b></code>, <code>bl.<b>readUInt32LE()</b></code>, <code>bl.<b>readInt16BE()</b></code>, <code>bl.<b>readInt16LE()</b></code>, <code>bl.<b>readUInt16BE()</b></code>, <code>bl.<b>readUInt16LE()</b></code>, <code>bl.<b>readInt8()</b></code>, <code>bl.<b>readUInt8()</b></code></a>\n  * <a href="#streams">Streams</a>\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n<a name="ctor"></a>\n### new BufferList([ callback | buffer | buffer array ])\nThe constructor takes an optional callback, if supplied, the callback will be called with an error argument followed by a reference to the **bl** instance, when `bl.end()` is called (i.e. from a piped stream). This is a convenient method of collecting the entire contents of a stream, particularly when the stream is *chunky*, such as a network stream.\n\nNormally, no arguments are required for the constructor, but you can initialise the list by passing in a single `Buffer` object or an array of `Buffer` object.\n\n`new` is not strictly required, if you don\'t instantiate a new object, it will be done automatically for you so you can create a new instance simply with:\n\n```js\nvar bl = require(\'bl\')\nvar myinstance = bl()\n\n// equivilant to:\n\nvar BufferList = require(\'bl\')\nvar myinstance = new BufferList()\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n<a name="length"></a>\n### bl.length\nGet the length of the list in bytes. This is the sum of the lengths of all of the buffers contained in the list, minus any initial offset for a semi-consumed buffer at the beginning. Should accurately represent the total number of bytes that can be read from the list.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n<a name="append"></a>\n### bl.append(buffer)\n`append(buffer)` adds an additional buffer or BufferList to the internal list.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n<a name="get"></a>\n### bl.get(index)\n`get()` will return the byte at the specified index.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n<a name="slice"></a>\n### bl.slice([ start, [ end ] ])\n`slice()` returns a new `Buffer` object containing the bytes within the range specified. Both `start` and `end` are optional and will default to the beginning and end of the list respectively.\n\nIf the requested range spans a single internal buffer then a slice of that buffer will be returned which shares the original memory range of that Buffer. If the range spans multiple buffers then copy operations will likely occur to give you a uniform Buffer.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n<a name="copy"></a>\n### bl.copy(dest, [ destStart, [ srcStart [, srcEnd ] ] ])\n`copy()` copies the content of the list in the `dest` buffer, starting from `destStart` and containing the bytes within the range specified with `srcStart` to `srcEnd`. `destStart`, `start` and `end` are optional and will default to the beginning of the `dest` buffer, and the beginning and end of the list respectively.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n<a name="duplicate"></a>\n### bl.duplicate()\n`duplicate()` performs a **shallow-copy** of the list. The internal Buffers remains the same, so if you change the underlying Buffers, the change will be reflected in both the original and the duplicate. This method is needed if you want to call `consume()` or `pipe()` and still keep the original list.Example:\n\n```js\nvar bl = new BufferList()\n\nbl.append(\'hello\')\nbl.append(\' world\')\nbl.append(\'\\n\')\n\nbl.duplicate().pipe(process.stdout, { end: false })\n\nconsole.log(bl.toString())\n```\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n<a name="consume"></a>\n### bl.consume(bytes)\n`consume()` will shift bytes *off the start of the list*. The number of bytes consumed don\'t need to line up with the sizes of the internal Buffers&mdash;initial offsets will be calculated accordingly in order to give you a consistent view of the data.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n<a name="toString"></a>\n### bl.toString([encoding, [ start, [ end ]]])\n`toString()` will return a string representation of the buffer. The optional `start` and `end` arguments are passed on to `slice()`, while the `encoding` is passed on to `toString()` of the resulting Buffer. See the [Buffer#toString()](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/buffer.html#buffer_buf_tostring_encoding_start_end) documentation for more information.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n<a name="readXX"></a>\n### bl.readDoubleBE(), bl.readDoubleLE(), bl.readFloatBE(), bl.readFloatLE(), bl.readInt32BE(), bl.readInt32LE(), bl.readUInt32BE(), bl.readUInt32LE(), bl.readInt16BE(), bl.readInt16LE(), bl.readUInt16BE(), bl.readUInt16LE(), bl.readInt8(), bl.readUInt8()\n\nAll of the standard byte-reading methods of the `Buffer` interface are implemented and will operate across internal Buffer boundaries transparently.\n\nSee the <b><code>[Buffer](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/buffer.html)</code></b> documentation for how these work.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n<a name="streams"></a>\n### Streams\n**bl** is a Node **[Duplex Stream](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_duplex)**, so it can be read from and written to like a standard Node stream.

6617 silly resolved     readme: '[RFC6265](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265) Cookies and CookieJar for Node.js\n\n![Tough Cookie](http://www.goinstant.com.s3.amazonaws.com/tough-cookie.jpg)\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/goinstant/node-cookie.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/goinstant/node-cookie)\n\n[![NPM Stats](https://nodei.co/npm/tough-cookie.png?downloads=true&stars=true)](https://npmjs.org/package/tough-cookie)\n![NPM Downloads](https://nodei.co/npm-dl/tough-cookie.png?months=9)\n\n# Synopsis\n\n``` javascript\nvar tough = require(\'tough-cookie\'); // note: not \'cookie\', \'cookies\' or \'node-cookie\'\nvar Cookie = tough.Cookie;\nvar cookie = Cookie.parse(header);\ncookie.value = \'somethingdifferent\';\nheader = cookie.toString();\n\nvar cookiejar = new tough.CookieJar();\ncookiejar.setCookie(cookie, \'http://currentdomain.example.com/path\', cb);\n// ...\ncookiejar.getCookies(\'http://example.com/otherpath\',function(err,cookies) {\n  res.headers[\'cookie\'] = cookies.join(\'; \');\n});\n```\n\n# Installation\n\nIt\'s _so_ easy!\n\n`npm install tough-cookie`\n\nRequires `punycode`, which should get installed automatically for you.  Note that node.js v0.6.2+ bundles punycode by default.\n\nWhy the name?  NPM modules `cookie`, `cookies` and `cookiejar` were already taken.\n\n# API\n\ntough\n=====\n\nFunctions on the module you get from `require(\'tough-cookie\')`.  All can be used as pure functions and don\'t need to be "bound".\n\nparseDate(string[,strict])\n-----------------\n\nParse a cookie date string into a `Date`.  Parses according to RFC6265 Section 5.1.1, not `Date.parse()`.  If strict is set to true then leading/trailing non-seperator characters around the time part will cause the parsing to fail (e.g. "Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:010 GMT" has an extra trailing zero but Chrome, an assumedly RFC-compliant browser, treats this as valid).\n\nformatDate(date)\n----------------\n\nFormat a Date into a RFC1123 string (the RFC6265-recommended format).\n\ncanonicalDomain(str)\n--------------------\n\nTransforms a domain-name into a canonical domain-name.  The canonical domain-name is a trimmed, lowercased, stripped-of-leading-dot and optionally punycode-encoded domain-name (Section 5.1.2 of RFC6265).  For the most part, this function is idempotent (can be run again on its output without ill effects).\n\ndomainMatch(str,domStr[,canonicalize=true])\n-------------------------------------------\n\nAnswers "does this real domain match the domain in a cookie?".  The `str` is the "current" domain-name and the `domStr` is the "cookie" domain-name.  Matches according to RFC6265 Section 5.1.3, but it helps to think of it as a "suffix match".\n\nThe `canonicalize` parameter will run the other two paramters through `canonicalDomain` or not.\n\ndefaultPath(path)\n-----------------\n\nGiven a current request/response path, gives the Path apropriate for storing in a cookie.  This is basically the "directory" of a "file" in the path, but is specified by Section 5.1.4 of the RFC.\n\nThe `path` parameter MUST be _only_ the pathname part of a URI (i.e. excludes the hostname, query, fragment, etc.).  This is the `.pathname` property of node\'s `uri.parse()` output.\n\npathMatch(reqPath,cookiePath)\n-----------------------------\n\nAnswers "does the request-path path-match a given cookie-path?" as per RFC6265 Section 5.1.4.  Returns a boolean.\n\nThis is essentially a prefix-match where `cookiePath` is a prefix of `reqPath`.\n\nparse(header[,strict=false])\n----------------------------\n\nalias for `Cookie.parse(header[,strict])`\n\nfromJSON(string)\n----------------\n\nalias for `Cookie.fromJSON(string)`\n\ngetPublicSuffix(hostname)\n-------------------------\n\nReturns the public suffix of this hostname.  The public suffix is the shortest domain-name upon which a cookie can be set.  Returns `null` if the hostname cannot have cookies set for it.\n\nFor example: `www.example.com` and `www.subdomain.example.com` both have public suffix `example.com`.\n\nFor further information, see http://publicsuffix.org/.  This module derives its list from that site.\n\ncookieCompare(a,b)\n------------------\n\nFor use with `.sort()`, sorts a list of cookies into the recommended order given in the RFC (Section 5.4 step 2).  Longest `.path`s go first, then sorted oldest to youngest.\n\n``` javascript\nvar cookies = [ /* unsorted array of Cookie objects */ ];\ncookies = cookies.sort(cookieCompare);\n```\n\npermuteDomain(domain)\n---------------------\n\nGenerates a list of all possible domains that `domainMatch()` the parameter.  May be handy for implementing cookie stores.\n\n\npermutePath(path)\n-----------------\n\nGenerates a list of all possible paths that `pathMatch()` the parameter.  May be handy for implementing cookie stores.\n\nCookie\n======\n\nCookie.parse(header[,strict=false])\n-----------------------------------\n\nParses a single Cookie or Set-Cookie HTTP header into a `Cookie` object.  Returns `undefined` if the string can\'t be parsed.  If in strict mode, returns `undefined` if the cookie doesn\'t follow the guidelines in section 4 of RFC6265.  Generally speaking, strict mode can be used to validate your own generated Set-Cookie headers, but acting as a client you want to be lenient and leave strict mode off.\n\nHere\'s how to process the Set-Cookie header(s) on a node HTTP/HTTPS response:\n\n``` javascript\nif (res.headers[\'set-cookie\'] instanceof Array)\n  cookies = res.headers[\'set-cookie\'].map(function (c) { return (Cookie.parse(c)); });\nelse\n  cookies = [Cookie.parse(res.headers[\'set-cookie\'])];\n```\n\nCookie.fromJSON(string)\n-----------------------\n\nConvert a JSON string to a `Cookie` object.  Does a `JSON.parse()` and converts the `.created`, `.lastAccessed` and `.expires` properties into `Date` objects.\n\nProperties\n==========\n\n  * _key_ - string - the name or key of the cookie (default "")\n  * _value_ - string - the value of the cookie (default "")\n  * _expires_ - `Date` - if set, the `Expires=` attribute of the cookie (defaults to the string `"Infinity"`). See `setExpires()`\n  * _maxAge_ - seconds - if set, the `Max-Age=` attribute _in seconds_ of the cookie.  May also be set to strings `"Infinity"` and `"-Infinity"` for non-expiry and immediate-expiry, respectively.  See `setMaxAge()`\n  * _domain_ - string - the `Domain=` attribute of the cookie\n  * _path_ - string - the `Path=` of the cookie\n  * _secure_ - boolean - the `Secure` cookie flag\n  * _httpOnly_ - boolean - the `HttpOnly` cookie flag\n  * _extensions_ - `Array` - any unrecognized cookie attributes as strings (even if equal-signs inside)\n\nAfter a cookie has been passed through `CookieJar.setCookie()` it will have the following additional attributes:\n\n  * _hostOnly_ - boolean - is this a host-only cookie (i.e. no Domain field was set, but was instead implied)\n  * _pathIsDefault_ - boolean - if true, there was no Path field on the cookie and `defaultPath()` was used to derive one.\n  * _created_ - `Date` - when this cookie was added to the jar\n  * _lastAccessed_ - `Date` - last time the cookie got accessed. Will affect cookie cleaning once implemented.  Using `cookiejar.getCookies(...)` will update this attribute.\n\nConstruction([{options}])\n------------\n\nReceives an options object that can contain any Cookie properties, uses the default for unspecified properties.\n\n.toString()\n-----------\n\nencode to a Set-Cookie header value.  The Expires cookie field is set using `formatDate()`, but is omitted entirely if `.expires` is `Infinity`.\n\n.cookieString()\n---------------\n\nencode to a Cookie header value (i.e. the `.key` and `.value` properties joined with \'=\').\n\n.setExpires(String)\n-------------------\n\nsets the expiry based on a date-string passed through `parseDate()`.  If parseDate returns `null` (i.e. can\'t parse this date string), `.expires` is set to `"Infinity"` (a string) is set.\n\n.setMaxAge(number)\n-------------------\n\nsets the maxAge in seconds.  Coerces `-Infinity` to `"-Infinity"` and `Infinity` to `"Infinity"` so it JSON serializes correctly.\n\n.expiryTime([now=Date.now()])\n-----------------------------\n\n.expiryDate([now=Date.now()])\n-----------------------------\n\nexpiryTime() Computes the absolute unix-epoch milliseconds that this cookie expires. expiryDate() works similarly, except it returns a `Date` object.  Note that in both cases the `now` parameter should be milliseconds.\n\nMax-Age takes precedence over Expires (as per the RFC). The `.created` attribute -- or, by default, the `now` paramter -- is used to offset the `.maxAge` attribute.\n\nIf Expires (`.expires`) is set, that\'s returned.\n\nOtherwise, `expiryTime()` returns `Infinity` and `expiryDate()` returns a `Date` object for "Tue, 19 Jan 2038 03:14:07 GMT" (latest date that can be expressed by a 32-bit `time_t`; the common limit for most user-agents).\n\n.TTL([now=Date.now()])\n---------\n\ncompute the TTL relative to `now` (milliseconds).  The same precedence rules as for `expiryTime`/`expiryDate` apply.\n\nThe "number" `Infinity` is returned for cookies without an explicit expiry and `0` is returned if the cookie is expired.  Otherwise a time-to-live in milliseconds is returned.\n\n.canonicalizedDoman()\n---------------------\n\n.cdomain()\n----------\n\nreturn the canonicalized `.domain` field.  This is lower-cased and punycode (RFC3490) encoded if the domain has any non-ASCII characters.\n\n.validate()\n-----------\n\nStatus: *IN PROGRESS*. Works for a few things, but is by no means comprehensive.\n\nvalidates cookie attributes for semantic correctness.  Useful for "lint" checking any Set-Cookie headers you generate.  For now, it returns a boolean, but eventually could return a reason string -- you can future-proof with this construct:\n\n``` javascript\nif (cookie.validate() === true) {\n  // it\'s tasty\n} else {\n  // yuck!\n}\n```\n\nCookieJar\n=========\n\nConstruction([store = new MemoryCookieStore()][, rejectPublicSuffixes])\n------------\n\nSimply use `new CookieJar()`.  If you\'d like to use a custom store, pass that to the constructor otherwise a `MemoryCookieStore` will be created and used.\n\n\nAttributes\n----------\n\n  * _rejectPublicSuffixes_ - boolean - reject cookies with domains like "com" and "co.uk" (default: `true`)\n\nSince eventually this module would like to support database/remote/etc. CookieJars, continuation passing style is used for CookieJar methods.\n\n.setCookie(cookieOrString, currentUrl, [{options},] cb(err,cookie))\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAttempt to set the cookie in the cookie jar.  If the operation fails, an error will be given to the callback `cb`, otherwise the cookie is passed through.  The cookie will have updated `.created`, `.lastAccessed` and `.hostOnly` properties.\n\nThe `options` object can be omitted and can have the following properties:\n\n  * _http_ - boolean - default `true` - indicates if this is an HTTP or non-HTTP API.  Affects HttpOnly cookies.\n  * _secure_ - boolean - autodetect from url - indicates if this is a "Secure" API.  If the currentUrl starts with `https:` or `wss:` then this is defaulted to `true`, otherwise `false`.\n  * _now_ - Date - default `new Date()` - what to use for the creation/access time of cookies\n  * _strict_ - boolean - default `false` - perform extra checks\n  * _ignoreError_ - boolean - default `false` - silently ignore things like parse errors and invalid domains.  CookieStore errors aren\'t ignored by this option.\n\nAs per the RFC, the `.hostOnly` property is set if there was no "Domain=" parameter in the cookie string (or `.domain` was null on the Cookie object).  The `.domain` property is set to the fully-qualified hostname of `currentUrl` in this case.  Matching this cookie requires an exact hostname match (not a `domainMatch` as per usual).\n\n.setCookieSync(cookieOrString, currentUrl, [{options}])\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nSynchronous version of `setCookie`; only works with synchronous stores (e.g. the default `MemoryCookieStore`).\n\n.storeCookie(cookie, [{options},] cb(err,cookie))\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n__REMOVED__ removed in lieu of the CookieStore API below\n\n.getCookies(currentUrl, [{options},] cb(err,cookies))\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nRetrieve the list of cookies that can be sent in a Cookie header for the current url.\n\nIf an error is encountered, that\'s passed as `err` to the callback, otherwise an `Array` of `Cookie` objects is passed.  The array is sorted with `cookieCompare()` unless the `{sort:false}` option is given.\n\nThe `options` object can be omitted and can have the following properties:\n\n  * _http_ - boolean - default `true` - indicates if this is an HTTP or non-HTTP API.  Affects HttpOnly cookies.\n  * _secure_ - boolean - autodetect from url - indicates if this is a "Secure" API.  If the currentUrl starts with `https:` or `wss:` then this is defaulted to `true`, otherwise `false`.\n  * _now_ - Date - default `new Date()` - what to use for the creation/access time of cookies\n  * _expire_ - boolean - default `true` - perform expiry-time checking of cookies and asynchronously remove expired cookies from the store.  Using `false` will return expired cookies and **not** remove them from the store (which is useful for replaying Set-Cookie headers, potentially).\n  * _allPaths_ - boolean - default `false` - if `true`, do not scope cookies by path. The default uses RFC-compliant path scoping. **Note**: may not be supported by the CookieStore `fetchCookies` function (the default MemoryCookieStore supports it).\n\nThe `.lastAccessed` property of the returned cookies will have been updated.\n\n.getCookiesSync(currentUrl, [{options}])\n----------------------------------------\n\nSynchronous version of `getCookies`; only works with synchronous stores (e.g. the default `MemoryCookieStore`).\n\n.getCookieString(...)\n---------------------\n\nAccepts the same options as `.getCookies()` but passes a string suitable for a Cookie header rather than an array to the callback.  Simply maps the `Cookie` array via `.cookieString()`.\n\n.getCookieStringSync(...)\n-------------------------\n\nSynchronous version of `getCookieString`; only works with synchronous stores (e.g. the default `MemoryCookieStore`).\n\n.getSetCookieStrings(...)\n-------------------------\n\nReturns an array of strings suitable for **Set-Cookie** headers. Accepts the same options as `.getCookies()`.  Simply maps the cookie array via `.toString()`.\n\n.getSetCookieStringsSync(...)\n-----------------------------\n\nSynchronous version of `getSetCookieStrings`; only works with synchronous stores (e.g. the default `MemoryCookieStore`).\n\nStore\n=====\n\nBase class for CookieJar stores.\n\n# CookieStore API\n\nThe storage model for each `CookieJar` instance can be replaced with a custom implementation.  The default is `MemoryCookieStore` which can be found in the `lib/memstore.js` file.  The API uses continuation-passing-style to allow for asynchronous stores.\n\nStores should inherit from the base `Store` class, which is available as `require(\'tough-cookie\').Store`.  Stores are asynchronous by default, but if `store.synchronous` is set, then the `*Sync` methods on the CookieJar can be used.\n\nAll `domain` parameters will have been normalized before calling.\n\nThe Cookie store must have all of the following methods.\n\nstore.findCookie(domain, path, key, cb(err,cookie))\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nRetrieve a cookie with the given domain, path and key (a.k.a. name).  The RFC maintains that exactly one of these cookies should exist in a store.  If the store is using versioning, this means that the latest/newest such cookie should be returned.\n\nCallback takes an error and the resulting `Cookie` object.  If no cookie is found then `null` MUST be passed instead (i.e. not an error).\n\nstore.findCookies(domain, path, cb(err,cookies))\n------------------------------------------------\n\nLocates cookies matching the given domain and path.  This is most often called in the context of `cookiejar.getCookies()` above.\n\nIf no cookies are found, the callback MUST be passed an empty array.\n\nThe resulting list will be checked for applicability to the current request according to the RFC (domain-match, path-match, http-only-flag, secure-flag, expiry, etc.), so it\'s OK to use an optimistic search algorithm when implementing this method.  However, the search algorithm used SHOULD try to find cookies that `domainMatch()` the domain and `pathMatch()` the path in order to limit the amount of checking that needs to be done.\n\nAs of version 0.9.12, the `allPaths` option to `cookiejar.getCookies()` above will cause the path here to be `null`.  If the path is `null`, path-matching MUST NOT be performed (i.e. domain-matching only).\n\nstore.putCookie(cookie, cb(err))\n--------------------------------\n\nAdds a new cookie to the store.  The implementation SHOULD replace any existing cookie with the same `.domain`, `.path`, and `.key` properties -- depending on the nature of the implementation, it\'s possible that between the call to `fetchCookie` and `putCookie` that a duplicate `putCookie` can occur.\n\nThe `cookie` object MUST NOT be modified; the caller will have already updated the `.creation` and `.lastAccessed` properties.\n\nPass an error if the cookie cannot be stored.\n\nstore.updateCookie(oldCookie, newCookie, cb(err))\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nUpdate an existing cookie.  The implementation MUST update the `.value` for a cookie with the same `domain`, `.path` and `.key`.  The implementation SHOULD check that the old value in the store is equivalent to `oldCookie` - how the conflict is resolved is up to the store.\n\nThe `.lastAccessed` property will always be different between the two objects and `.created` will always be the same.  Stores MAY ignore or defer the `.lastAccessed` change at the cost of affecting how cookies are sorted (or selected for deletion).\n\nStores may wish to optimize changing the `.value` of the cookie in the store versus storing a new cookie.  If the implementation doesn\'t define this method a stub that calls `putCookie(newCookie,cb)` will be added to the store object.\n\nThe `newCookie` and `oldCookie` objects MUST NOT be modified.\n\nPass an error if the newCookie cannot be stored.\n\nstore.removeCookie(domain, path, key, cb(err))\n----------------------------------------------\n\nRemove a cookie from the store (see notes on `findCookie` about the uniqueness constraint).\n\nThe implementation MUST NOT pass an error if the cookie doesn\'t exist; only pass an error due to the failure to remove an existing cookie.\n\nstore.removeCookies(domain, path, cb(err))\n------------------------------------------\n\nRemoves matching cookies from the store.  The `path` paramter is optional, and if missing means all paths in a domain should be removed.\n\nPass an error ONLY if removing any existing cookies failed.\n\n# TODO\n\n  * _full_ RFC5890/RFC5891 canonicalization for domains in `cdomain()`\n    * the optional `punycode` requirement implements RFC3492, but RFC6265 requires RFC5891\n  * better tests for `validate()`?\n\n# Copyright and License\n\n(tl;dr: MIT with some MPL/1.1)\n\nCopyright 2012- GoInstant, Inc. and other contributors.

Likewise, just as with the Digest scheme,\nthe key is never included in authenticated requests. Instead, it is used to calculate a request MAC value which is\nincluded in its place.\n\nHowever, **Hawk** has several differences from Digest. In particular, while both use a nonce to limit the possibility of\nreplay attacks, in **Hawk** the client generates the nonce and uses it in combination with a timestamp, leading to less\n"chattiness" (interaction with the server).\n\nAlso unlike Digest, this scheme is not intended to protect the key itself (the password in Digest) because\nthe client and server must both have access to the key material in the clear.\n\nThe primary design goals of this scheme are to:\n* simplify and improve HTTP authentication for services that are unwilling or unable to deploy TLS for all resources,\n* secure credentials against leakage (e.g., when the client uses some form of dynamic configuration to determine where\n  to send an authenticated request), and\n* avoid the exposure of credentials sent to a malicious server over an unauthenticated secure channel due to client\n  failure to validate the server\'s identity as part of its TLS handshake.\n\nIn addition, **Hawk** supports a method for granting third-parties temporary access to individual resources using\na query parameter called _bewit_ (in falconry, a leather strap used to attach a tracking device to the leg of a hawk).\n\nThe **Hawk** scheme requires the establishment of a shared symmetric key between the client and the server,\nwhich is beyond the scope of this module. Typically, the shared credentials are established via an initial\nTLS-protected phase or derived from some other shared confidential information available to both the client\nand the server.\n\n\n## Replay Protection\n\nWithout replay protection, an attacker can use a compromised (but otherwise valid and authenticated) request more \nthan once, gaining access to a protected resource. To mitigate this, clients include both a nonce and a timestamp when \nmaking requests. This gives the server enough information to prevent replay attacks.\n\nThe nonce is generated by the client, and is a string unique across all requests with the same timestamp and\nkey identifier combination. \n\nThe timestamp enables the server to restrict the validity period of the credentials where requests occuring afterwards\nare rejected. It also removes the need for the server to retain an unbounded number of nonce values for future checks.\nBy default, **Hawk** uses a time window of 1 minute to allow for time skew between the client and server (which in\npractice translates to a maximum of 2 minutes as the skew can be positive or negative).\n\nUsing a timestamp requires the client\'s clock to be in sync with the server\'s clock. **Hawk** requires both the client\nclock and the server clock to use NTP to ensure synchronization. However, given the limitations of some client types\n(e.g. browsers) to deploy NTP, the server provides the client with its current time (in seconds precision) in response\nto a bad timestamp.\n\nThere is no expectation that the client will adjust its system clock to match the server (in fact, this would be a\npotential attack vector). Instead, the client only uses the server\'s time to calculate an offset used only\nfor communications with that particular server. The protocol rewards clients with synchronized clocks by reducing\nthe number of round trips required to authenticate the first request.\n\n\n## Usage Example\n\nServer code:\n\n```javascript\nvar Http = require(\'http\');\nvar Hawk = require(\'hawk\');\n\n\n// Credentials lookup function\n\nvar credentialsFunc = function (id, callback) {\n\n    var credentials = {\n        key: \'werxhqb98rpaxn39848xrunpaw3489ruxnpa98w4rxn\',\n        algorithm: \'sha256\',\n        user: \'Steve\'\n    };\n\n    return callback(null, credentials);\n};\n\n// Create HTTP server\n\nvar handler = function (req, res) {\n\n    // Authenticate incoming request\n\n    Hawk.server.authenticate(req, credentialsFunc, {}, function (err, credentials, artifacts) {\n\n        // Prepare response\n\n        var payload = (!err ? \'Hello \' + credentials.user + \' \' + artifacts.ext : \'Shoosh!\');\n        var headers = { \'Content-Type\': \'text/plain\' };\n\n        // Generate Server-Authorization response header\n\n        var header = Hawk.server.header(credentials, artifacts, { payload: payload, contentType: headers[\'Content-Type\'] });\n        headers[\'Server-Authorization\'] = header;\n\n        // Send the response back\n\n        res.writeHead(!err ? 200 : 401, headers);\n        res.end(payload);\n    });\n};\n\n// Start server\n\nHttp.createServer(handler).listen(8000, \'example.com\');\n```\n\nClient code:\n\n```javascript\nvar Request = require(\'request\');\nvar Hawk = require(\'hawk\');\n\n\n// Client credentials\n\nvar credentials = {\n    id: \'dh37fgj492je\',\n    key: \'werxhqb98rpaxn39848xrunpaw3489ruxnpa98w4rxn\',\n    algorithm: \'sha256\'\n}\n\n// Request options\n\nvar requestOptions = {\n    uri: \'http://example.com:8000/resource/1?b=1&a=2\',\n    method: \'GET\',\n    headers: {}\n};\n\n// Generate Authorization request header\n\nvar header = Hawk.client.header(\'http://example.com:8000/resource/1?b=1&a=2\', \'GET\', { credentials: credentials, ext: \'some-app-data\' });\nrequestOptions.headers.Authorization = header.field;\n\n// Send authenticated request\n\nRequest(requestOptions, function (error, response, body) {\n\n    // Authenticate the server\'s response\n\n    var isValid = Hawk.client.authenticate(response, credentials, header.artifacts, { payload: body });\n\n    // Output results\n\n    console.log(response.statusCode + \': \' + body + (isValid ? \' (valid)\' : \' (invalid)\'));\n});\n```\n\n**Hawk** utilized the [**SNTP**](https://github.com/hueniverse/sntp) module for time sync management. By default, the local\nmachine time is used. To automatically retrieve and synchronice the clock within the application, use the SNTP \'start()\' method.\n\n```javascript\nHawk.sntp.start();\n```\n\n\n## Protocol Example\n\nThe client attempts to access a protected resource without authentication, sending the following HTTP request to\nthe resource server:\n\n```\nGET /resource/1?b=1&a=2 HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com:8000\n```\n\nThe resource server returns an authentication challenge.\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized\nWWW-Authenticate: Hawk\n```\n\nThe client has previously obtained a set of **Hawk** credentials for accessing resources on the "http://example.com/"\nserver. The **Hawk** credentials issued to the client include the following attributes:\n\n* Key identifier: dh37fgj492je\n* Key: werxhqb98rpaxn39848xrunpaw3489ruxnpa98w4rxn\n* Algorithm: sha256\n\nThe client generates the authentication header by calculating a timestamp (e.g. the number of seconds since January 1,\n1970 00:00:00 GMT), generating a nonce, and constructing the normalized request string (each value followed by a newline\ncharacter):\n\n```\nhawk.1.header\n1353832234\nj4h3g2\nGET\n/resource/1?b=1&a=2\nexample.com\n8000\n\nsome-app-ext-data\n\n```\n\nThe request MAC is calculated using HMAC with the specified hash algorithm "sha256" and the key over the normalized request string.\nThe result is base64-encoded to produce the request MAC:\n\n```\n6R4rV5iE+NPoym+WwjeHzjAGXUtLNIxmo1vpMofpLAE=\n```\n\nThe client includes the **Hawk** key identifier, timestamp, nonce, application specific data, and request MAC with the request using\nthe HTTP `Authorization` request header field:\n\n```\nGET /resource/1?b=1&a=2 HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com:8000\nAuthorization: Hawk id="dh37fgj492je", ts="1353832234", nonce="j4h3g2", ext="some-app-ext-data", mac="6R4rV5iE+NPoym+WwjeHzjAGXUtLNIxmo1vpMofpLAE="\n```\n\nThe server validates the request by calculating the request MAC again based on the request received and verifies the validity\nand scope of the **Hawk** credentials. If valid, the server responds with the requested resource.\n\n\n### Payload Validation\n\n**Hawk** provides optional payload validation. When generating the authentication header, the client calculates a payload hash\nusing the specified hash algorithm. The hash is calculated over the concatenated value of (each followed by a newline character):\n* `hawk.1.payload`\n* the content-type in lowercase, without any parameters (e.g. `application/json`)\n* the request payload prior to any content encoding (the exact representation requirements should be specified by the server for payloads other than simple single-part ascii to ensure interoperability)\n\nFor example:\n\n* Payload: `Thank you for flying Hawk`\n* Content Type: `text/plain`\n* Hash (sha256): `Yi9LfIIFRtBEPt74PVmbTF/xVAwPn7ub15ePICfgnuY=`\n\nResults in the following input to the payload hash function (newline terminated values):\n\n```\nhawk.1.payload\ntext/plain\nThank you for flying Hawk\n\n```\n\nWhich produces the following hash value:\n\n```\nYi9LfIIFRtBEPt74PVmbTF/xVAwPn7ub15ePICfgnuY=\n```\n\nThe client constructs the normalized request string (newline terminated values):\n\n```\nhawk.1.header\n1353832234\nj4h3g2\nPOST\n/resource/1?a=1&b=2\nexample.com\n8000\nYi9LfIIFRtBEPt74PVmbTF/xVAwPn7ub15ePICfgnuY=\nsome-app-ext-data\n\n```\n\nThen calculates the request MAC and includes the **Hawk** key identifier, timestamp, nonce, payload hash, application specific data,\nand request MAC, with the request using the HTTP `Authorization` request header field:\n\n```\nPOST /resource/1?a=1&b=2 HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com:8000\nAuthorization: Hawk id="dh37fgj492je", ts="1353832234", nonce="j4h3g2", hash="Yi9LfIIFRtBEPt74PVmbTF/xVAwPn7ub15ePICfgnuY=", ext="some-app-ext-data", mac="aSe1DERmZuRl3pI36/9BdZmnErTw3sNzOOAUlfeKjVw="\n```\n\nIt is up to the server if and when it validates the payload for any given request, based solely on it\'s security policy\nand the nature of the data included.\n\nIf the payload is available at the time of authentication, the server uses the hash value provided by the client to construct\nthe normalized string and validates the MAC. If the MAC is valid, the server calculates the payload hash and compares the value\nwith the provided payload hash in the header. In many cases, checking the MAC first is faster than calculating the payload hash.\n\nHowever, if the payload is not available at authentication time (e.g. too large to fit in memory, streamed elsewhere, or processed\nat a different stage in the application), the server may choose to defer payload validation for later by retaining the hash value\nprovided by the client after validating the MAC.\n\nIt is important to note that MAC validation does not mean the hash value provided by the client is valid, only that the value\nincluded in the header was not modified. Without calculating the payload hash on the server and comparing it to the value provided\nby the client, the payload may be modified by an attacker.\n\n\n## Response Payload Validation\n\n**Hawk** provides partial response payload validation. The server includes the `Server-Authorization` response header which enables the\nclient to authenticate the response and ensure it is talking to the right server. **Hawk** defines the HTTP `Server-Authorization` header\nas a response header using the exact same syntax as the `Authorization` request header field.\n\nThe header is contructed using the same process as the client\'s request header. The server uses the same credentials and other\nartifacts provided by the client to constructs the normalized request string. The `ext` and `hash` values are replaced with\nnew values based on the server response. The rest as identical to those used by the client.\n\nThe result MAC digest is included with the optional `hash` and `ext` values:\n\n```\nServer-Authorization: Hawk mac="XIJRsMl/4oL+nn+vKoeVZPdCHXB4yJkNnBbTbHFZUYE=", hash="f9cDF/TDm7TkYRLnGwRMfeDzT6LixQVLvrIKhh0vgmM=", ext="response-specific"\n```\n\n\n## Browser Support and Considerations\n\nA browser script is provided for including using a `<script>` tag in [lib/browser.js](/lib/browser.js). It\'s also a [component](http://component.io/hueniverse/hawk).\n\n**Hawk** relies on the _Server-Authorization_ and _WWW-Authenticate_ headers in its response to communicate with the client.\nTherefore, in case of CORS requests, it is important to consider sending _Access-Control-Expose-Headers_ with the value\n_"WWW-Authenticate, Server-Authorization"_ on each response from your server. As explained in the\n[specifications](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/#access-control-expose-headers-response-header), it will indicate that these headers\ncan safely be accessed by the client (using getResponseHeader() on the XmlHttpRequest object). Otherwise you will be met with a\n["simple response header"](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/#simple-response-header) which excludes these fields and would prevent the\nHawk client from authenticating the requests.You can read more about the why and how in this\n[article](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/cors/#toc-adding-cors-support-to-the-server)\n\n\n# Single URI Authorization\n\nThere are cases in which limited and short-term access to a protected resource is granted to a third party which does not\nhave access to the shared credentials. For example, displaying a protected image on a web page accessed by anyone. **Hawk**\nprovides limited support for such URIs in the form of a _bewit_ - a URI query parameter appended to the request URI which contains\nthe necessary credentials to authenticate the request.\n\nBecause of the significant security risks involved in issuing such access, bewit usage is purposely limited only to GET requests\nand for a finite period of time. Both the client and server can issue bewit credentials, however, the server should not use the same\ncredentials as the client to maintain clear traceability as to who issued which credentials.\n\nIn order to simplify implementation, bewit credentials do not support single-use policy and can be replayed multiple times within\nthe granted access timeframe. \n\n\n## Bewit Usage Example\n\nServer code:\n\n```javascript\nvar Http = require(\'http\');\nvar Hawk = require(\'hawk\');\n\n\n// Credentials lookup function\n\nvar credentialsFunc = function (id, callback) {\n\n    var credentials = {\n        key: \'werxhqb98rpaxn39848xrunpaw3489ruxnpa98w4rxn\',\n        algorithm: \'sha256\'\n    };\n\n    return callback(null, credentials);\n};\n\n// Create HTTP server\n\nvar handler = function (req, res) {\n\n    Hawk.uri.authenticate(req, credentialsFunc, {}, function (err, credentials, attributes) {\n\n        res.writeHead(!err ? 200 : 401, { \'Content-Type\': \'text/plain\' });\n        res.end(!err ? \'Access granted\' : \'Shoosh!\');\n    });\n};\n\nHttp.createServer(handler).listen(8000, \'example.com\');\n```\n\nBewit code generation:\n\n```javascript\nvar Request = require(\'request\');\nvar Hawk = require(\'hawk\');\n\n\n// Client credentials\n\nvar credentials = {\n    id: \'dh37fgj492je\',\n    key: \'werxhqb98rpaxn39848xrunpaw3489ruxnpa98w4rxn\',\n    algorithm: \'sha256\'\n}\n\n// Generate bewit\n\nvar duration = 60 * 5;      // 5 Minutes\nvar bewit = Hawk.uri.getBewit(\'http://example.com:8080/resource/1?b=1&a=2\', { credentials: credentials, ttlSec: duration, ext: \'some-app-data\' });\nvar uri = \'http://example.com:8000/resource/1?b=1&a=2\' + \'&bewit=\' + bewit;\n```\n\n\n# Security Considerations\n\nThe greatest sources of security risks are usually found not in **Hawk** but in the policies and procedures surrounding its use.\nImplementers are strongly encouraged to assess how this module addresses their security requirements. This section includes\nan incomplete list of security considerations that must be reviewed and understood before deploying **Hawk** on the server.\nMany of the protections provided in **Hawk** depends on whether and how they are used.\n\n### MAC Keys Transmission\n\n**Hawk** does not provide any mechanism for obtaining or transmitting the set of shared credentials required. Any mechanism used\nto obtain **Hawk** credentials must ensure that these transmissions are protected using transport-layer mechanisms such as TLS.\n\n### Confidentiality of Requests\n\nWhile **Hawk** provides a mechanism for verifying the integrity of HTTP requests, it provides no guarantee of request\nconfidentiality. Unless other precautions are taken, eavesdroppers will have full access to the request content. Servers should\ncarefully consider the types of data likely to be sent as part of such requests, and employ transport-layer security mechanisms\nto protect sensitive resources.\n\n### Spoofing by Counterfeit Servers\n\n**Hawk** provides limited verification of the server authenticity. When receiving a response back from the server, the server\nmay choose to include a response `Server-Authorization` header which the client can use to verify the response. However, it is up to\nthe server to determine when such measure is included, to up to the client to enforce that policy.\n\nA hostile party could take advantage of this by intercepting the client\'s requests and returning misleading or otherwise\nincorrect responses. Service providers should consider such attacks when developing services using this protocol, and should\nrequire transport-layer security for any requests where the authenticity of the resource server or of server responses is an issue.\n\n### Plaintext Storage of Credentials\n\nThe **Hawk** key functions the same way passwords do in traditional authentication systems. In order to compute the request MAC,\nthe server must have access to the key in plaintext form. This is in contrast, for example, to modern operating systems, which\nstore only a one-way hash of user credentials.\n\nIf an attacker were to gain access to these keys - or worse, to the server\'s database of all such keys - he or she would be able\nto perform any action on behalf of any resource owner. Accordingly, it is critical that servers protect these keys from unauthorized\naccess.\n\n### Entropy of Keys\n\nUnless a transport-layer security protocol is used, eavesdroppers will have full access to authenticated requests and request\nMAC values, and will thus be able to mount offline brute-force attacks to recover the key used. Servers should be careful to\nassign keys which are long enough, and random enough, to resist such attacks for at least the length of time that the **Hawk**\ncredentials are valid.\n\nFor example, if the credentials are valid for two weeks, servers should ensure that it is not possible to mount a brute force\nattack that recovers the key in less than two weeks. Of course, servers are urged to err on the side of caution, and use the\nlongest key reasonable.\n\nIt is equally important that the pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) used to generate these keys be of sufficiently high\nquality. Many PRNG implementations generate number sequences that may appear to be random, but which nevertheless exhibit\npatterns or other weaknesses which make cryptanalysis or brute force attacks easier. Implementers should be careful to use\ncryptographically secure PRNGs to avoid these problems.\n\n### Coverage Limitations\n\nThe request MAC only covers the HTTP `Host` header and optionally the `Content-Type` header. It does not cover any other headers\nwhich can often affect how the request body is interpreted by the server. If the server behavior is influenced by the presence\nor value of such headers, an attacker can manipulate the request headers without being detected. Implementers should use the\n`ext` feature to pass application-specific information via the `Authorization` header which is protected by the request MAC.\n\nThe response authentication, when performed, only covers the response payload, content-type, and the request information \nprovided by the client in it\'s request (method, resource, timestamp, nonce, etc.). It does not cover the HTTP status code or\nany other response header field (e.g. Location) which can affect the client\'s behaviour.\n\n### Future Time Manipulation\n\nThe protocol relies on a clock sync between the client and server. To accomplish this, the server informs the client of its\ncurrent time when an invalid timestamp is received.\n\nIf an attacker is able to manipulate this information and cause the client to use an incorrect time, it would be able to cause\nthe client to generate authenticated requests using time in the future. Such requests will fail when sent by the client, and will\nnot likely leave a trace on the server (given the common implementation of nonce, if at all enforced). The attacker will then\nbe able to replay the request at the correct time without detection.\n\nThe client must only use the time information provided by the server if:\n* it was delivered over a TLS connection and the server identity has been verified, or\n* the `tsm` MAC digest calculated using the same client credentials over the timestamp has been verified.\n\n### Client Clock Poisoning\n\nWhen receiving a request with a bad timestamp, the server provides the client with its current time. The client must never use\nthe time received from the server to adjust its own clock, and must only use it to calculate an offset for communicating with\nthat particular server.\n\n### Bewit Limitations\n\nSpecial care must be taken when issuing bewit credentials to third parties. Bewit credentials are valid until expiration and cannot\nbe revoked or limited without using other means. Whatever resource they grant access to will be completely exposed to anyone with\naccess to the bewit credentials which act as bearer credentials for that particular resource. While bewit usage is limited to GET\nrequests only and therefore cannot be used to perform transactions or change server state, it can still be used to expose private\nand sensitive information.\n\n### Host Header Forgery\n\nHawk validates the incoming request MAC against the incoming HTTP Host header. However, unless the optional `host` and `port`\noptions are used with `server.authenticate()`, a malicous client can mint new host names pointing to the server\'s IP address and\nuse that to craft an attack by sending a valid request that\'s meant for another hostname than the one used by the server. Server\nimplementors must manually verify that the host header received matches their expectation (or use the options mentioned above).\n\n# Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### Where is the protocol specification?\n\nIf you are looking for some prose explaining how all this works, **this is it**. **Hawk** is being developed as an open source\nproject instead of a standard. In other words, the [code](/hueniverse/hawk/tree/master/lib) is the specification. Not sure about\nsomething? Open an issue!\n\n### Is it done?\n\nAs of version 0.10.0, **Hawk** is feature-complete. However, until this module reaches version 1.0.0 it is considered experimental\nand is likely to change. This also means your feedback and contribution are very welcome. Feel free to open issues with questions\nand suggestions.\n\n### Where can I find **Hawk** implementations in other languages?\n\n**Hawk**\'s only reference implementation is provided in JavaScript as a node.js module. However, it has been ported to other languages.\nThe full list is maintained [here](https://github.com/hueniverse/hawk/issues?labels=port&state=closed). Please add an issue if you are\nworking on another port. A cross-platform test-suite is in the works.\n\n### Why isn\'t the algorithm part of the challenge or dynamically negotiated?\n\nThe algorithm used is closely related to the key issued as different algorithms require different key sizes (and other\nrequirements). While some keys can be used for multiple algorithm, the protocol is designed to closely bind the key and algorithm\ntogether as part of the issued credentials.\n\n### Why is Host and Content-Type the only headers covered by the request MAC?\n\nIt is really hard to include other headers. Headers can be changed by proxies and other intermediaries and there is no\nwell-established way to normalize them. Many platforms change the case of header field names and values. The only\nstraight-forward solution is to include the headers in some blob (say, base64 encoded JSON) and include that with the request,\nan approach taken by JWT and other such formats. However, that design violates the HTTP header boundaries, repeats information,\nand introduces other security issues because firewalls will not be aware of these "hidden" headers. In addition, any information\nrepeated must be compared to the duplicated information in the header and therefore only moves the problem elsewhere.\n\n### Why not just use HTTP Digest?\n\nDigest requires pre-negotiation to establish a nonce. This means you can\'t just make a request - you must first send\na protocol handshake to the server. This pattern has become unacceptable for most web services, especially mobile\nwhere extra round-trip are costly.\n\n### Why bother with all this nonce and timestamp business?\n\n**Hawk** is an attempt to find a reasonable, practical compromise between security and usability. OAuth 1.0 got timestamp\nand nonces halfway right but failed when it came to scalability and consistent developer experience. **Hawk** addresses\nit by requiring the client to sync its clock, but provides it with tools to accomplish it.\n\nIn general, replay protection is a matter of application-specific threat model. It is less of an issue on a TLS-protected\nsystem where the clients are implemented using best practices and are under the control of the server. Instead of dropping\nreplay protection, **Hawk** offers a required time window and an optional nonce verification. Together, it provides developers\nwith the ability to decide how to enforce their security policy without impacting the client\'s implementation.\n\n### What are `app` and `dlg` in the authorization header and normalized mac string?\n\nThe original motivation for **Hawk** was to replace the OAuth 1.0 use cases. This included both a simple client-server mode which\nthis module is specifically designed for, and a delegated access mode which is being developed separately in\n[Oz](https://github.com/hueniverse/oz). In addition to the **Hawk** use cases, Oz requires another attribute: the application id `app`.\nThis provides binding between the credentials and the application in a way that prevents an attacker from tricking an application\nto use credentials issued to someone else. It also has an optional \'delegated-by\' attribute `dlg` which is the application id of the\napplication the credentials were directly issued to. The goal of these two additions is to allow Oz to utilize **Hawk** directly,\nbut with the additional security of delegated credentials.\n\n### What is the purpose of the static strings used in each normalized MAC input?\n\nWhen calculating a hash or MAC, a static prefix (tag) is added. The prefix is used to prevent MAC values from being\nused or reused for a purpose other than what they were created for (i.e. prevents switching MAC values between a request,\nresponse, and a bewit use cases). It also protects against exploits created after a potential change in how the protocol\ncreates the normalized string. For example, if a future version would switch the order of nonce and timestamp, it\ncan create an exploit opportunity for cases where the nonce is similar in format to a timestamp.\n\n### Does **Hawk** have anything to do with OAuth?\n\nShort answer: no.\n\n**Hawk** was originally proposed as the OAuth MAC Token specification. However, the OAuth working group in its consistent\nincompetence failed to produce a final, usable solution to address one of the most popular use cases of OAuth 1.0 - using it\nto authenticate simple client-server transactions (i.e. two-legged). As you can guess, the OAuth working group is still hard\nat work to produce more garbage.\n\n**Hawk** provides a simple HTTP authentication scheme for making client-server requests. It does not address the OAuth use case\nof delegating access to a third party. If you are looking for an OAuth alternative, check out [Oz](https://github.com/hueniverse/oz).\n\n# Implementations\n\n- [Logibit Hawk in F#/.Net](https://github.com/logibit/logibit.hawk/)\n- [Tent Hawk in Ruby](https://github.com/tent/hawk-ruby)\n- [Wealdtech in Java](https://github.com/wealdtech/hawk)\n- [Kumar\'s Mohawk in Python](https://github.com/kumar303/mohawk/)\n\n# Acknowledgements\n\n**Hawk** is a derivative work of the [HTTP MAC Authentication Scheme](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hammer-oauth-v2-mac-token-05) proposal\nco-authored by Ben Adida, Adam Barth, and Eran Hammer, which in turn was based on the OAuth 1.0 community specification.\n\nSpecial thanks to Ben Laurie for his always insightful feedback and advice.\n\nThe **Hawk** logo was created by [Chris Carrasco](http://chriscarrasco.com).\n',

7554 silly resolved     readme: 'node-bindings\n=============\n### Helper module for loading your native module\'s .node file\n\nThis is a helper module for authors of Node.js native addon modules.\nIt is basically the "swiss army knife" of `require()`ing your native module\'s\n`.node` file.\n\nThroughout the course of Node\'s native addon history, addons have ended up being\ncompiled in a variety of different places, depending on which build tool and which\nversion of node was used. To make matters worse, now the _gyp_ build tool can\nproduce either a _Release_ or _Debug_ build, each being built into different\nlocations.\n\nThis module checks _all_ the possible locations that a native addon would be built\nat, and returns the first one that loads successfully.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nInstall with `npm`:\n\n``` bash\n$ npm install bindings\n```\n\nOr add it to the `"dependencies"` section of your _package.json_ file.\n\n\nExample\n-------\n\n`require()`ing the proper bindings file for the current node version, platform\nand architecture is as simple as:\n\n``` js\nvar bindings = require(\'bindings\')(\'binding.node\')\n\n// Use your bindings defined in your C files\nbindings.your_c_function()\n```\n\n\nNice Error Output\n-----------------\n\nWhen the `.node` file could not be loaded, `node-bindings` throws an Error with\na nice error message telling you exactly what was tried. You can also check the\n`err.tries` Array property.\n\n```\nError: Could not load the bindings file. Tried:\n → /Users/nrajlich/ref/build/binding.node\n → /Users/nrajlich/ref/build/Debug/binding.node\n → /Users/nrajlich/ref/build/Release/binding.node\n → /Users/nrajlich/ref/out/Debug/binding.node\n → /Users/nrajlich/ref/Debug/binding.node\n → /Users/nrajlich/ref/out/Release/binding.node\n → /Users/nrajlich/ref/Release/binding.node\n → /Users/nrajlich/ref/build/default/binding.node\n → /Users/nrajlich/ref/compiled/0.8.2/darwin/x64/binding.node\n    at bindings (/Users/nrajlich/ref/node_modules/bindings/bindings.js:84:13)\n    at Object.<anonymous> (/Users/nrajlich/ref/lib/ref.js:5:47)\n    at Module._compile (module.js:449:26)\n    at Object.Module._extensions..js (module.js:467:10)\n    at Module.load (module.js:356:32)\n    at Function.Module._load (module.js:312:12)\n    ...\n```\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2012 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\'Software\'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \'AS IS\', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n',

7554 silly resolved     readme: '# debug\n\n  tiny node.js debugging utility modelled after node core\'s debugging technique.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n$ npm install debug\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n With `debug` you simply invoke the exported function to generate your debug function, passing it a name which will determine if a noop function is returned, or a decorated `console.error`, so all of the `console` format string goodies you\'re used to work fine. A unique color is selected per-function for visibility.\n\nExample _app.js_:\n\n```js\nvar debug = require(\'debug\')(\'http\')\n  , http = require(\'http\')\n  , name = \'My App\';\n\n// fake app\n\ndebug(\'booting %s\', name);\n\nhttp.createServer(function(req, res){\n  debug(req.method + \' \' + req.url);\n  res.end(\'hello\\n\');\n}).listen(3000, function(){\n  debug(\'listening\');\n});\n\n// fake worker of some kind\n\nrequire(\'./worker\');\n```\n\nExample _worker.js_:\n\n```js\nvar debug = require(\'debug\')(\'worker\');\n\nsetInterval(function(){\n  debug(\'doing some work\');\n}, 1000);\n```\n\n The __DEBUG__ environment variable is then used to enable these based on space or comma-delimited names. Here are some examples:\n\n  ![debug http and worker](http://f.cl.ly/items/18471z1H402O24072r1J/Screenshot.png)\n\n  ![debug worker](http://f.cl.ly/items/1X413v1a3M0d3C2c1E0i/Screenshot.png)\n\n#### Windows note\n\n On Windows the environment variable is set using the `set` command. \n \n ```cmd\n set DEBUG=*,-not_this\n ```\n\nThen, run the program to be debugged as usual.\n\n## Millisecond diff\n\n  When actively developing an application it can be useful to see when the time spent between one `debug()` call and the next. Suppose for example you invoke `debug()` before requesting a resource, and after as well, the "+NNNms" will show you how much time was spent between calls.\n\n  ![](http://f.cl.ly/items/2i3h1d3t121M2Z1A3Q0N/Screenshot.png)\n\n  When stdout is not a TTY, `Date#toUTCString()` is used, making it more useful for logging the debug information as shown below:\n\n  ![](http://f.cl.ly/items/112H3i0e0o0P0a2Q2r11/Screenshot.png)\n\n## Conventions\n\n If you\'re using this in one or more of your libraries, you _should_ use the name of your library so that developers may toggle debugging as desired without guessing names. If you have more than one debuggers you _should_ prefix them with your library name and use ":" to separate features. For example "bodyParser" from Connect would then be "connect:bodyParser".\n\n## Wildcards\n\n  The `*` character may be used as a wildcard. Suppose for example your library has debuggers named "connect:bodyParser", "connect:compress", "connect:session", instead of listing all three with `DEBUG=connect:bodyParser,connect.compress,connect:session`, you may simply do `DEBUG=connect:*`, or to run everything using this module simply use `DEBUG=*`.\n\n  You can also exclude specific debuggers by prefixing them with a "-" character.  For example, `DEBUG=*,-connect:*` would include all debuggers except those starting with "connect:".\n\n## Browser support\n\n  Debug works in the browser as well, currently persisted by `localStorage`. Consider the situation shown below where you have `worker:a` and `worker:b`, and wish to debug both. Somewhere in the code on your page, include:\n\n```js\nwindow.myDebug = require("debug");\n```\n\n  ("debug" is a global object in the browser so we give this object a different name.) When your page is open in the browser, type the following in the console:\n\n```js\nmyDebug.enable("worker:*")\n```\n\n  Refresh the page. Debug output will continue to be sent to the console until it is disabled by typing `myDebug.disable()` in the console.\n\n```js\na = debug(\'worker:a\');\nb = debug(\'worker:b\');\n\nsetInterval(function(){\n  a(\'doing some work\');\n}, 1000);\n\nsetInterval(function(){\n  b(\'doing some work\');\n}, 1200);\n```\n\n#### Web Inspector Colors\n\n  Colors are also enabled on "Web Inspectors" that understand the `%c` formatting\n  option. These are WebKit web inspectors, Firefox ([since version\n  31](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2014/05/editable-box-model-multiple-selection-sublime-text-keys-much-more-firefox-developer-tools-episode-31/))\n  and the Firebug plugin for Firefox (any version).\n\n  Colored output looks something like:\n\n  ![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/71256/3139768/b98c5fd8-e8ef-11e3-862a-f7253b6f47c6.png)\n\n### stderr vs stdout\n\nYou can set an alternative logging method per-namespace by overriding the `log` method on a per-namespace or globally:\n\nExample _stdout.js_:\n\n```js\nvar debug = require(\'debug\');\nvar error = debug(\'app:error\');\n\n// by default stderr is used\nerror(\'goes to stderr!\');\n\nvar log = debug(\'app:log\');\n// set this namespace to log via console.log\nlog.log = console.log.bind(console); // don\'t forget to bind to console!\nlog(\'goes to stdout\');\nerror(\'still goes to stderr!\');\n\n// set all output to go via console.info\n// overrides all per-namespace log settings\ndebug.log = console.info.bind(console);\nerror(\'now goes to stdout via console.info\');\nlog(\'still goes to stdout, but via console.info now\');\n```\n\n## Authors\n\n - TJ Holowaychuk\n - Nathan Rajlich\n\n## License\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2014 TJ Holowaychuk &lt;tj@vision-media.ca&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\'Software\'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \'AS IS\', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n',

Optimist figures\nout how to format a handy help string automatically.\n\nline_count.js\n\n````javascript\n#!/usr/bin/env node\nvar argv = require(\'optimist\')\n    .usage(\'Count the lines in a file.\\nUsage: $0\')\n    .demand(\'f\')\n    .alias(\'f\', \'file\')\n    .describe(\'f\', \'Load a file\')\n    .argv\n;\n\nvar fs = require(\'fs\');\nvar s = fs.createReadStream(argv.file);\n\nvar lines = 0;\ns.on(\'data\', function (buf) {\n    lines += buf.toString().match(/\\n/g).length;\n});\n\ns.on(\'end\', function () {\n    console.log(lines);\n});\n````\n\n***\n\n    $ node line_count.js\n    Count the lines in a file.\n    Usage: node ./line_count.js\n\n    Options:\n      -f, --file  Load a file  [required]\n\n    Missing required arguments: f\n\n    $ node line_count.js --file line_count.js \n    20\n    \n    $ node line_count.js -f line_count.js \n    20\n\nmethods\n=======\n\nBy itself,\n\n````javascript\nrequire(\'optimist\').argv\n`````\n\nwill use `process.argv` array to construct the `argv` object.\n\nYou can pass in the `process.argv` yourself:\n\n````javascript\nrequire(\'optimist\')([ \'-x\', \'1\', \'-y\', \'2\' ]).argv\n````\n\nor use .parse() to do the same thing:\n\n````javascript\nrequire(\'optimist\').parse([ \'-x\', \'1\', \'-y\', \'2\' ])\n````\n\nThe rest of these methods below come in just before the terminating `.argv`.\n\n.alias(key, alias)\n------------------\n\nSet key names as equivalent such that updates to a key will propagate to aliases\nand vice-versa.\n\nOptionally `.alias()` can take an object that maps keys to aliases.\n\n.default(key, value)\n--------------------\n\nSet `argv[key]` to `value` if no option was specified on `process.argv`.\n\nOptionally `.default()` can take an object that maps keys to default values.\n\n.demand(key)\n------------\n\nIf `key` is a string, show the usage information and exit if `key` wasn\'t\nspecified in `process.argv`.\n\nIf `key` is a number, demand at least as many non-option arguments, which show\nup in `argv._`.\n\nIf `key` is an Array, demand each element.\n\n.describe(key, desc)\n--------------------\n\nDescribe a `key` for the generated usage information.\n\nOptionally `.describe()` can take an object that maps keys to descriptions.\n\n.options(key, opt)\n------------------\n\nInstead of chaining together `.alias().demand().default()`, you can specify\nkeys in `opt` for each of the chainable methods.\n\nFor example:\n\n````javascript\nvar argv = require(\'optimist\')\n    .options(\'f\', {\n        alias : \'file\',\n        default : \'/etc/passwd\',\n    })\n    .argv\n;\n````\n\nis the same as\n\n````javascript\nvar argv = require(\'optimist\')\n    .alias(\'f\', \'file\')\n    .default(\'f\', \'/etc/passwd\')\n    .argv\n;\n````\n\nOptionally `.options()` can take an object that maps keys to `opt` parameters.\n\n.usage(message)\n---------------\n\nSet a usage message to show which commands to use. Inside `message`, the string\n`$0` will get interpolated to the current script name or node command for the\npresent script similar to how `$0` works in bash or perl.\n\n.check(fn)\n----------\n\nCheck that certain conditions are met in the provided arguments.\n\nIf `fn` throws or returns `false`, show the thrown error, usage information, and\nexit.\n\n.boolean(key)\n-------------\n\nInterpret `key` as a boolean. If a non-flag option follows `key` in\n`process.argv`, that string won\'t get set as the value of `key`.\n\nIf `key` never shows up as a flag in `process.arguments`, `argv[key]` will be\n`false`.\n\nIf `key` is an Array, interpret all the elements as booleans.\n\n.string(key)\n------------\n\nTell the parser logic not to interpret `key` as a number or boolean.\nThis can be useful if you need to preserve leading zeros in an input.\n\nIf `key` is an Array, interpret all the elements as strings.\n\n.wrap(columns)\n--------------\n\nFormat usage output to wrap at `columns` many columns.\n\n.help()\n-------\n\nReturn the generated usage string.\n\n.showHelp(fn=console.error)\n---------------------------\n\nPrint the usage data using `fn` for printing.\n\n.parse(args)\n------------\n\nParse `args` instead of `process.argv`. Returns the `argv` object.\n\n.argv\n-----\n\nGet the arguments as a plain old object.\n\nArguments without a corresponding flag show up in the `argv._` array.\n\nThe script name or node command is available at `argv.$0` similarly to how `$0`\nworks in bash or perl.\n\nparsing tricks\n==============\n\nstop parsing\n------------\n\nUse `--` to stop parsing flags and stuff the remainder into `argv._`.\n\n    $ node examples/reflect.js -a 1 -b 2 -- -c 3 -d 4\n    { _: [ \'-c\', \'3\', \'-d\', \'4\' ],\n      \'$0\': \'node ./examples/reflect.js\',\n      a: 1,\n      b: 2 }\n\nnegate fields\n-------------\n\nIf you want to explicity set a field to false instead of just leaving it\nundefined or to override a default you can do `--no-key`.\n\n    $ node examples/reflect.js -a --no-b\n    { _: [],\n      \'$0\': \'node ./examples/reflect.js\',\n      a: true,\n      b: false }\n\nnumbers\n-------\n\nEvery argument that looks like a number (`!isNaN(Number(arg))`) is converted to\none. This way you can just `net.createConnection(argv.port)` and you can add\nnumbers out of `argv` with `+` without having that mean concatenation,\nwhich is super frustrating.\n\nduplicates\n----------\n\nIf you specify a flag multiple times it will get turned into an array containing\nall the values in order.\n\n    $ node examples/reflect.js -x 5 -x 8 -x 0\n    { _: [],\n      \'$0\': \'node ./examples/reflect.js\',\n        x: [ 5, 8, 0 ] }\n\ndot notation\n------------\n\nWhen you use dots (`.`s) in argument names, an implicit object path is assumed.\nThis lets you organize arguments into nested objects.\n\n     $ node examples/reflect.js --foo.bar.baz=33 --foo.quux=5\n     { _: [],\n       \'$0\': \'node ./examples/reflect.js\',\n         foo: { bar: { baz: 33 }, quux: 5 } }\n\nshort numbers\n-------------\n\nShort numeric `head -n5` style argument work too:\n\n    $ node reflect.js -n123 -m456\n    { \'3\': true,\n      \'6\': true,\n      _: [],\n      \'$0\': \'node ./reflect.js\',\n      n: 123,\n      m: 456 }\n\ninstallation\n============\n\nWith [npm](http://github.com/isaacs/npm), just do:\n    npm install optimist\n \nor clone this project on github:\n\n    git clone http://github.com/substack/node-optimist.git\n\nTo run the tests with [expresso](http://github.com/visionmedia/expresso),\njust do:\n    \n    expresso\n\ninspired By\n===========\n\nThis module is loosely inspired by Perl\'s\n[Getopt::Casual](http://search.cpan.org/~photo/Getopt-Casual-0.13.1/Casual.pm).\n',

The text inside the curly braces is {indexOrName[,alignment][:formatString]}.\nIf alignment is positive the text is right aligned. If alignment is negative it will be left aligned.\n\n### Object\n\n| Specifier | Name                         |\n|-----------|------------------------------|\n| json      | JSON.stringify               |\n| inspect   | util.inspect                 |\n\n### Numbers\n\n| Specifier | Name                         | Example          | Output         |\n|-----------|------------------------------|------------------|----------------|\n| 0         | Zero placeholder             | {0:00.0000}      | 02.1200        |\n| #         | Digit placeholder            | {0:#,###}        | 1,234          |\n| x         | Lowercase hex                | {0:x4}           | 01fc           |\n| X         | Uppercase hex                | {0:X4}           | 01FC           |\n\n### Dates\n\n| Specifier | Name                            | Example                         |\n|-----------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| sd        | Short date                      | 10/12/2002                      |\n| D         | Long date                       | December 10, 2002               |\n| t         | Short time                      | 10:11 PM                        |\n| T         | Long time                       | 10:11:29 PM                     |\n| fdt       | Full date & time                | December 10, 2002 10:11 PM      |\n| F         | Full date & time (long)         | December 10, 2002 10:11:29 PM   |\n| g         | Default date & time             | 10/12/2002 10:11 PM             |\n| G         | Default date & time (long)      | 10/12/2002 10:11:29 PM          |\n| md        | Month day pattern               | December 10                     |\n| r         | RFC1123 date string             | Tue, 10 Dec 2002 22:11:29 +0500 |\n| s         | Sortable date string            | 2002-12-10T22:11:29             |\n| d         | Date single digit               | 1                               |\n| dd        | Date leading zero               | 01                              |\n| ddd       | Short day name                  | Mon                             |\n| dddd      | Long day name                   | Monday                          |\n| f         | Fraction of second (1 digit)    | 1                               |\n| ff        | Fraction of second (2 digit)    | 24                              |\n| fff       | Fraction of second (3 digit)    | 345                             |\n| h         | Hour 12-hour format 1 digit     | 5                               |\n| hh        | Hour 12-hour format 2 digits    | 05                              |\n| H         | Hour 24-hour format 1 digit     | 5                               |\n| HH        | Hour 24-hour format 2 digits    | 05                              |\n| mm        | Minutes 2 digits                | 23                              |\n| M         | Month single digit              | 2                               |\n| MM        | Month leading zero              | 02                              |\n| MMM       | Month short name                | Feb                             |\n| MMMM      | Month long name                 | February                        |\n| ss        | Seconds 2 digits                | 54                              |\n| tt        | AM/PM                           | AM                              |\n| yy        | Year 2 digits                   | 12                              |\n| yyyy      | Year 4 digits                   | 2012                            |\n| zz        | Time zone offset                | 05                              |\n| +zz       | Time zone offset leading +      | +05                             |\n| zzz       | Time zone offset full           | 05:00                           |\n| zzzz      | Time zone offset full           | 0500                            |\n| +zzzz     | Time zone offset full leading + | +0500                           |\n\n### sf.TimeSpan\n\n| Specifier | Name                | Example                |\n|-----------|---------------------|------------------------|\n| y         | Years               | 2                      |\n| M         | Months              | 6                      |\n| d         | Days                | 8                      |\n| h         | Hours               | 10                     |\n| m         | Minutes             | 15                     |\n| s         | Seconds             | 5                      |\n| f         | Fraction of Seconds | 9                      |\n\nIf you prefix the specifier with \'^\' you will get the total number of that value.

7554 silly resolved     readme: '# Async.js\n\n[![Build Status via Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/caolan/async.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/caolan/async)\n\n\nAsync is a utility module which provides straight-forward, powerful functions\nfor working with asynchronous JavaScript. Although originally designed for\nuse with [Node.js](http://nodejs.org), it can also be used directly in the\nbrowser. Also supports [component](https://github.com/component/component).\n\nAsync provides around 20 functions that include the usual \'functional\'\nsuspects (`map`, `reduce`, `filter`, `each`…) as well as some common patterns\nfor asynchronous control flow (`parallel`, `series`, `waterfall`…). All these\nfunctions assume you follow the Node.js convention of providing a single\ncallback as the last argument of your `async` function.\n\n\n## Quick Examples\n\n```javascript\nasync.map([\'file1\',\'file2\',\'file3\'], fs.stat, function(err, results){\n    // results is now an array of stats for each file\n});\n\nasync.filter([\'file1\',\'file2\',\'file3\'], fs.exists, function(results){\n    // results now equals an array of the existing files\n});\n\nasync.parallel([\n    function(){ ... },\n    function(){ ... }\n], callback);\n\nasync.series([\n    function(){ ... },\n    function(){ ... }\n]);\n```\n\nThere are many more functions available so take a look at the docs below for a\nfull list. This module aims to be comprehensive, so if you feel anything is\nmissing please create a GitHub issue for it.\n\n## Common Pitfalls\n\n### Binding a context to an iterator\n\nThis section is really about `bind`, not about `async`. If you are wondering how to\nmake `async` execute your iterators in a given context, or are confused as to why\na method of another library isn\'t working as an iterator, study this example:\n\n```js\n// Here is a simple object with an (unnecessarily roundabout) squaring method\nvar AsyncSquaringLibrary = {\n  squareExponent: 2,\n  square: function(number, callback){ \n    var result = Math.pow(number, this.squareExponent);\n    setTimeout(function(){\n      callback(null, result);\n    }, 200);\n  }\n};\n\nasync.map([1, 2, 3], AsyncSquaringLibrary.square, function(err, result){\n  // result is [NaN, NaN, NaN]\n  // This fails because the `this.squareExponent` expression in the square\n  // function is not evaluated in the context of AsyncSquaringLibrary, and is\n  // therefore undefined.\n});\n\nasync.map([1, 2, 3], AsyncSquaringLibrary.square.bind(AsyncSquaringLibrary), function(err, result){\n  // result is [1, 4, 9]\n  // With the help of bind we can attach a context to the iterator before\n  // passing it to async. Now the square function will be executed in its \n  // \'home\' AsyncSquaringLibrary context and the value of `this.squareExponent`\n  // will be as expected.\n});\n```\n\n## Download\n\nThe source is available for download from\n[GitHub](http://github.com/caolan/async).\nAlternatively, you can install using Node Package Manager (`npm`):\n\n    npm install async\n\n__Development:__ [async.js](https://github.com/caolan/async/raw/master/lib/async.js) - 29.6kb Uncompressed\n\n## In the Browser\n\nSo far it\'s been tested in IE6, IE7, IE8, FF3.6 and Chrome 5. \n\nUsage:\n\n```html\n<script type="text/javascript" src="async.js"></script>\n<script type="text/javascript">\n\n    async.map(data, asyncProcess, function(err, results){\n        alert(results);\n    });\n\n</script>\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\n### Collections\n\n* [`each`](#each)\n* [`eachSeries`](#eachSeries)\n* [`eachLimit`](#eachLimit)\n* [`map`](#map)\n* [`mapSeries`](#mapSeries)\n* [`mapLimit`](#mapLimit)\n* [`filter`](#filter)\n* [`filterSeries`](#filterSeries)\n* [`reject`](#reject)\n* [`rejectSeries`](#rejectSeries)\n* [`reduce`](#reduce)\n* [`reduceRight`](#reduceRight)\n* [`detect`](#detect)\n* [`detectSeries`](#detectSeries)\n* [`sortBy`](#sortBy)\n* [`some`](#some)\n* [`every`](#every)\n* [`concat`](#concat)\n* [`concatSeries`](#concatSeries)\n\n### Control Flow\n\n* [`series`](#seriestasks-callback)\n* [`parallel`](#parallel)\n* [`parallelLimit`](#parallellimittasks-limit-callback)\n* [`whilst`](#whilst)\n* [`doWhilst`](#doWhilst)\n* [`until`](#until)\n* [`doUntil`](#doUntil)\n* [`forever`](#forever)\n* [`waterfall`](#waterfall)\n* [`compose`](#compose)\n* [`seq`](#seq)\n* [`applyEach`](#applyEach)\n* [`applyEachSeries`](#applyEachSeries)\n* [`queue`](#queue)\n* [`priorityQueue`](#priorityQueue)\n* [`cargo`](#cargo)\n* [`auto`](#auto)\n* [`retry`](#retry)\n* [`iterator`](#iterator)\n* [`apply`](#apply)\n* [`nextTick`](#nextTick)\n* [`times`](#times)\n* [`timesSeries`](#timesSeries)\n\n### Utils\n\n* [`memoize`](#memoize)\n* [`unmemoize`](#unmemoize)\n* [`log`](#log)\n* [`dir`](#dir)\n* [`noConflict`](#noConflict)\n\n\n## Collections\n\n<a name="forEach" />\n<a name="each" />\n### each(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nApplies the function `iterator` to each item in `arr`, in parallel.\nThe `iterator` is called with an item from the list, and a callback for when it\nhas finished. If the `iterator` passes an error to its `callback`, the main\n`callback` (for the `each` function) is immediately called with the error.\n\nNote, that since this function applies `iterator` to each item in parallel,\nthere is no guarantee that the iterator functions will complete in order.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `arr` - An array to iterate over.\n* `iterator(item, callback)` - A function to apply to each item in `arr`.\n  The iterator is passed a `callback(err)` which must be called once it has \n  completed. If no error has occured, the `callback` should be run without \n  arguments or with an explicit `null` argument.\n* `callback(err)` - A callback which is called when all `iterator` functions\n  have finished, or an error occurs.\n\n__Examples__\n\n\n```js\n// assuming openFiles is an array of file names and saveFile is a function\n// to save the modified contents of that file:\n\nasync.each(openFiles, saveFile, function(err){\n    // if any of the saves produced an error, err would equal that error\n});\n```\n\n```js\n// assuming openFiles is an array of file names \n\nasync.each(openFiles, function( file, callback) {\n  \n  // Perform operation on file here.\n  console.log(\'Processing file \' + file);\n  \n  if( file.length > 32 ) {\n    console.log(\'This file name is too long\');\n    callback(\'File name too long\');\n  } else {\n    // Do work to process file here\n    console.log(\'File processed\');\n    callback();\n  }\n}, function(err){\n    // if any of the file processing produced an error, err would equal that error\n    if( err ) {\n      // One of the iterations produced an error.\n      // All processing will now stop.\n      console.log(\'A file failed to process\');\n    } else {\n      console.log(\'All files have been processed successfully\');\n    }\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="forEachSeries" />\n<a name="eachSeries" />\n### eachSeries(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nThe same as [`each`](#each), only `iterator` is applied to each item in `arr` in\nseries. The next `iterator` is only called once the current one has completed. \nThis means the `iterator` functions will complete in order.\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="forEachLimit" />\n<a name="eachLimit" />\n### eachLimit(arr, limit, iterator, callback)\n\nThe same as [`each`](#each), only no more than `limit` `iterator`s will be simultaneously \nrunning at any time.\n\nNote that the items in `arr` are not processed in batches, so there is no guarantee that \nthe first `limit` `iterator` functions will complete before any others are started.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `arr` - An array to iterate over.\n* `limit` - The maximum number of `iterator`s to run at any time.\n* `iterator(item, callback)` - A function to apply to each item in `arr`.\n  The iterator is passed a `callback(err)` which must be called once it has \n  completed. If no error has occured, the callback should be run without \n  arguments or with an explicit `null` argument.\n* `callback(err)` - A callback which is called when all `iterator` functions\n  have finished, or an error occurs.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\n// Assume documents is an array of JSON objects and requestApi is a\n// function that interacts with a rate-limited REST api.\n\nasync.eachLimit(documents, 20, requestApi, function(err){\n    // if any of the saves produced an error, err would equal that error\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="map" />\n### map(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nProduces a new array of values by mapping each value in `arr` through\nthe `iterator` function. The `iterator` is called with an item from `arr` and a\ncallback for when it has finished processing. Each of these callback takes 2 arguments: \nan `error`, and the transformed item from `arr`. If `iterator` passes an error to this \ncallback, the main `callback` (for the `map` function) is immediately called with the error.\n\nNote, that since this function applies the `iterator` to each item in parallel,\nthere is no guarantee that the `iterator` functions will complete in order. \nHowever, the results array will be in the same order as the original `arr`.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `arr` - An array to iterate over.\n* `iterator(item, callback)` - A function to apply to each item in `arr`.\n  The iterator is passed a `callback(err, transformed)` which must be called once \n  it has completed with an error (which can be `null`) and a transformed item.\n* `callback(err, results)` - A callback which is called when all `iterator`\n  functions have finished, or an error occurs. Results is an array of the\n  transformed items from the `arr`.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nasync.map([\'file1\',\'file2\',\'file3\'], fs.stat, function(err, results){\n    // results is now an array of stats for each file\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="mapSeries" />\n### mapSeries(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nThe same as [`map`](#map), only the `iterator` is applied to each item in `arr` in\nseries.

The result is an array of the\n  transformed items from the original `arr`.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nasync.mapLimit([\'file1\',\'file2\',\'file3\'], 1, fs.stat, function(err, results){\n    // results is now an array of stats for each file\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="select" />\n<a name="filter" />\n### filter(arr, iterator, callback)\n\n__Alias:__ `select`\n\nReturns a new array of all the values in `arr` which pass an async truth test.\n_The callback for each `iterator` call only accepts a single argument of `true` or\n`false`; it does not accept an error argument first!_ This is in-line with the\nway node libraries work with truth tests like `fs.exists`. This operation is\nperformed in parallel, but the results array will be in the same order as the\noriginal.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `arr` - An array to iterate over.\n* `iterator(item, callback)` - A truth test to apply to each item in `arr`.\n  The `iterator` is passed a `callback(truthValue)`, which must be called with a \n  boolean argument once it has completed.\n* `callback(results)` - A callback which is called after all the `iterator`\n  functions have finished.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nasync.filter([\'file1\',\'file2\',\'file3\'], fs.exists, function(results){\n    // results now equals an array of the existing files\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="selectSeries" />\n<a name="filterSeries" />\n### filterSeries(arr, iterator, callback)\n\n__Alias:__ `selectSeries`\n\nThe same as [`filter`](#filter) only the `iterator` is applied to each item in `arr` in\nseries. The next `iterator` is only called once the current one has completed. \nThe results array will be in the same order as the original.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="reject" />\n### reject(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nThe opposite of [`filter`](#filter). Removes values that pass an `async` truth test.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="rejectSeries" />\n### rejectSeries(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nThe same as [`reject`](#reject), only the `iterator` is applied to each item in `arr`\nin series.\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="reduce" />\n### reduce(arr, memo, iterator, callback)\n\n__Aliases:__ `inject`, `foldl`\n\nReduces `arr` into a single value using an async `iterator` to return\neach successive step. `memo` is the initial state of the reduction. \nThis function only operates in series. \n\nFor performance reasons, it may make sense to split a call to this function into \na parallel map, and then use the normal `Array.prototype.reduce` on the results. \nThis function is for situations where each step in the reduction needs to be async; \nif you can get the data before reducing it, then it\'s probably a good idea to do so.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `arr` - An array to iterate over.\n* `memo` - The initial state of the reduction.\n* `iterator(memo, item, callback)` - A function applied to each item in the\n  array to produce the next step in the reduction. The `iterator` is passed a\n  `callback(err, reduction)` which accepts an optional error as its first \n  argument, and the state of the reduction as the second. If an error is \n  passed to the callback, the reduction is stopped and the main `callback` is \n  immediately called with the error.\n* `callback(err, result)` - A callback which is called after all the `iterator`\n  functions have finished. Result is the reduced value.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nasync.reduce([1,2,3], 0, function(memo, item, callback){\n    // pointless async:\n    process.nextTick(function(){\n        callback(null, memo + item)\n    });\n}, function(err, result){\n    // result is now equal to the last value of memo, which is 6\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="reduceRight" />\n### reduceRight(arr, memo, iterator, callback)\n\n__Alias:__ `foldr`\n\nSame as [`reduce`](#reduce), only operates on `arr` in reverse order.\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="detect" />\n### detect(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nReturns the first value in `arr` that passes an async truth test. The\n`iterator` is applied in parallel, meaning the first iterator to return `true` will\nfire the detect `callback` with that result. That means the result might not be\nthe first item in the original `arr` (in terms of order) that passes the test.\n\nIf order within the original `arr` is important, then look at [`detectSeries`](#detectSeries).\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `arr` - An array to iterate over.\n* `iterator(item, callback)` - A truth test to apply to each item in `arr`.\n  The iterator is passed a `callback(truthValue)` which must be called with a \n  boolean argument once it has completed.\n* `callback(result)` - A callback which is called as soon as any iterator returns\n  `true`, or after all the `iterator` functions have finished. Result will be\n  the first item in the array that passes the truth test (iterator) or the\n  value `undefined` if none passed.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nasync.detect([\'file1\',\'file2\',\'file3\'], fs.exists, function(result){\n    // result now equals the first file in the list that exists\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="detectSeries" />\n### detectSeries(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nThe same as [`detect`](#detect), only the `iterator` is applied to each item in `arr`\nin series. This means the result is always the first in the original `arr` (in\nterms of array order) that passes the truth test.\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="sortBy" />\n### sortBy(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nSorts a list by the results of running each `arr` value through an async `iterator`.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `arr` - An array to iterate over.\n* `iterator(item, callback)` - A function to apply to each item in `arr`.\n  The iterator is passed a `callback(err, sortValue)` which must be called once it\n  has completed with an error (which can be `null`) and a value to use as the sort\n  criteria.\n* `callback(err, results)` - A callback which is called after all the `iterator`\n  functions have finished, or an error occurs. Results is the items from\n  the original `arr` sorted by the values returned by the `iterator` calls.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nasync.sortBy([\'file1\',\'file2\',\'file3\'], function(file, callback){\n    fs.stat(file, function(err, stats){\n        callback(err, stats.mtime);\n    });\n}, function(err, results){\n    // results is now the original array of files sorted by\n    // modified date\n});\n```\n\n__Sort Order__\n\nBy modifying the callback parameter the sorting order can be influenced:\n\n```js\n//ascending order\nasync.sortBy([1,9,3,5], function(x, callback){\n    callback(err, x);\n}, function(err,result){\n    //result callback\n} );\n\n//descending order\nasync.sortBy([1,9,3,5], function(x, callback){\n    callback(err, x*-1);    //<- x*-1 instead of x, turns the order around\n}, function(err,result){\n    //result callback\n} );\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="some" />\n### some(arr, iterator, callback)\n\n__Alias:__ `any`\n\nReturns `true` if at least one element in the `arr` satisfies an async test.\n_The callback for each iterator call only accepts a single argument of `true` or\n`false`; it does not accept an error argument first!_ This is in-line with the\nway node libraries work with truth tests like `fs.exists`. Once any iterator\ncall returns `true`, the main `callback` is immediately called.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `arr` - An array to iterate over.\n* `iterator(item, callback)` - A truth test to apply to each item in the array\n  in parallel. The iterator is passed a callback(truthValue) which must be \n  called with a boolean argument once it has completed.\n* `callback(result)` - A callback which is called as soon as any iterator returns\n  `true`, or after all the iterator functions have finished. Result will be\n  either `true` or `false` depending on the values of the async tests.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nasync.some([\'file1\',\'file2\',\'file3\'], fs.exists, function(result){\n    // if result is true then at least one of the files exists\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="every" />\n### every(arr, iterator, callback)\n\n__Alias:__ `all`\n\nReturns `true` if every element in `arr` satisfies an async test.\n_The callback for each `iterator` call only accepts a single argument of `true` or\n`false`; it does not accept an error argument first!_ This is in-line with the\nway node libraries work with truth tests like `fs.exists`.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `arr` - An array to iterate over.\n* `iterator(item, callback)` - A truth test to apply to each item in the array\n  in parallel.

Returns the\nconcatenated list. The `iterator`s are called in parallel, and the results are\nconcatenated as they return. There is no guarantee that the results array will\nbe returned in the original order of `arr` passed to the `iterator` function.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `arr` - An array to iterate over.\n* `iterator(item, callback)` - A function to apply to each item in `arr`.\n  The iterator is passed a `callback(err, results)` which must be called once it \n  has completed with an error (which can be `null`) and an array of results.\n* `callback(err, results)` - A callback which is called after all the `iterator`\n  functions have finished, or an error occurs. Results is an array containing\n  the concatenated results of the `iterator` function.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nasync.concat([\'dir1\',\'dir2\',\'dir3\'], fs.readdir, function(err, files){\n    // files is now a list of filenames that exist in the 3 directories\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="concatSeries" />\n### concatSeries(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nSame as [`concat`](#concat), but executes in series instead of parallel.\n\n\n## Control Flow\n\n<a name="series" />\n### series(tasks, [callback])\n\nRun the functions in the `tasks` array in series, each one running once the previous\nfunction has completed. If any functions in the series pass an error to its\ncallback, no more functions are run, and `callback` is immediately called with the value of the error. \nOtherwise, `callback` receives an array of results when `tasks` have completed.\n\nIt is also possible to use an object instead of an array. Each property will be\nrun as a function, and the results will be passed to the final `callback` as an object\ninstead of an array. This can be a more readable way of handling results from\n[`series`](#series).\n\n**Note** that while many implementations preserve the order of object properties, the\n[ECMAScript Language Specifcation](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-8.6) \nexplicitly states that\n\n> The mechanics and order of enumerating the properties is not specified.\n\nSo if you rely on the order in which your series of functions are executed, and want\nthis to work on all platforms, consider using an array. \n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `tasks` - An array or object containing functions to run, each function is passed\n  a `callback(err, result)` it must call on completion with an error `err` (which can\n  be `null`) and an optional `result` value.\n* `callback(err, results)` - An optional callback to run once all the functions\n  have completed.

This function gets a results array (or object) containing all \n  the result arguments passed to the task callbacks.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nasync.parallel([\n    function(callback){\n        setTimeout(function(){\n            callback(null, \'one\');\n        }, 200);\n    },\n    function(callback){\n        setTimeout(function(){\n            callback(null, \'two\');\n        }, 100);\n    }\n],\n// optional callback\nfunction(err, results){\n    // the results array will equal [\'one\',\'two\'] even though\n    // the second function had a shorter timeout.\n});\n\n\n// an example using an object instead of an array\nasync.parallel({\n    one: function(callback){\n        setTimeout(function(){\n            callback(null, 1);\n        }, 200);\n    },\n    two: function(callback){\n        setTimeout(function(){\n            callback(null, 2);\n        }, 100);\n    }\n},\nfunction(err, results) {\n    // results is now equals to: {one: 1, two: 2}\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="parallelLimit" />\n### parallelLimit(tasks, limit, [callback])\n\nThe same as [`parallel`](#parallel), only `tasks` are executed in parallel \nwith a maximum of `limit` tasks executing at any time.\n\nNote that the `tasks` are not executed in batches, so there is no guarantee that \nthe first `limit` tasks will complete before any others are started.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `tasks` - An array or object containing functions to run, each function is passed \n  a `callback(err, result)` it must call on completion with an error `err` (which can\n  be `null`) and an optional `result` value.\n* `limit` - The maximum number of `tasks` to run at any time.\n* `callback(err, results)` - An optional callback to run once all the functions\n  have completed. This function gets a results array (or object) containing all \n  the result arguments passed to the `task` callbacks.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="whilst" />\n### whilst(test, fn, callback)\n\nRepeatedly call `fn`, while `test` returns `true`. Calls `callback` when stopped,\nor an error occurs.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `test()` - synchronous truth test to perform before each execution of `fn`.\n* `fn(callback)` - A function which is called each time `test` passes. The function is\n  passed a `callback(err)`, which must be called once it has completed with an \n  optional `err` argument.\n* `callback(err)` - A callback which is called after the test fails and repeated\n  execution of `fn` has stopped.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nvar count = 0;\n\nasync.whilst(\n    function () { return count < 5; },\n    function (callback) {\n        count++;\n        setTimeout(callback, 1000);\n    },\n    function (err) {\n        // 5 seconds have passed\n    }\n);\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="doWhilst" />\n### doWhilst(fn, test, callback)\n\nThe post-check version of [`whilst`](#whilst). To reflect the difference in \nthe order of operations, the arguments `test` and `fn` are switched. \n\n`doWhilst` is to `whilst` as `do while` is to `while` in plain JavaScript.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="until" />\n### until(test, fn, callback)\n\nRepeatedly call `fn` until `test` returns `true`. Calls `callback` when stopped,\nor an error occurs.\n\nThe inverse of [`whilst`](#whilst).\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="doUntil" />\n### doUntil(fn, test, callback)\n\nLike [`doWhilst`](#doWhilst), except the `test` is inverted. Note the argument ordering differs from `until`.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="forever" />\n### forever(fn, errback)\n\nCalls the asynchronous function `fn` with a callback parameter that allows it to\ncall itself again, in series, indefinitely.\n\nIf an error is passed to the callback then `errback` is called with the\nerror, and execution stops, otherwise it will never be called.\n\n```js\nasync.forever(\n    function(next) {\n        // next is suitable for passing to things that need a callback(err [, whatever]);\n        // it will result in this function being called again.\n    },\n    function(err) {\n        // if next is called with a value in its first parameter, it will appear\n        // in here as \'err\', and execution will stop.\n    }\n);\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="waterfall" />\n### waterfall(tasks, [callback])\n\nRuns the `tasks` array of functions in series, each passing their results to the next in\nthe array. However, if any of the `tasks` pass an error to their own callback, the\nnext function is not executed, and the main `callback` is immediately called with\nthe error.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `tasks` - An array of functions to run, each function is passed a \n  `callback(err, result1, result2, ...)` it must call on completion. The first\n  argument is an error (which can be `null`) and any further arguments will be \n  passed as arguments in order to the next task.\n* `callback(err, [results])` - An optional callback to run once all the functions\n  have completed. This will be passed the results of the last task\'s callback.\n\n\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nasync.waterfall([\n    function(callback){\n        callback(null, \'one\', \'two\');\n    },\n    function(arg1, arg2, callback){\n      // arg1 now equals \'one\' and arg2 now equals \'two\'\n        callback(null, \'three\');\n    },\n    function(arg1, callback){\n        // arg1 now equals \'three\'\n        callback(null, \'done\');\n    }\n], function (err, result) {\n   // result now equals \'done\'    \n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n<a name="compose" />\n### compose(fn1, fn2...)\n\nCreates a function which is a composition of the passed asynchronous\nfunctions. Each function consumes the return value of the function that\nfollows. Composing functions `f()`, `g()`, and `h()` would produce the result of\n`f(g(h()))`, only this version uses callbacks to obtain the return values.\n\nEach function is executed with the `this` binding of the composed function.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `functions...` - the asynchronous functions to compose\n\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nfunction add1(n, callback) {\n    setTimeout(function () {\n        callback(null, n + 1);\n    }, 10);\n}\n\nfunction mul3(n, callback) {\n    setTimeout(function () {\n        callback(null, n * 3);\n    }, 10);\n}\n\nvar add1mul3 = async.compose(mul3, add1);\n\nadd1mul3(4, function (err, result) {\n   // result now equals 15\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n<a name="seq" />\n### seq(fn1, fn2...)\n\nVersion of the compose function that is more natural to read.\nEach following function consumes the return value of the latter function. \n\nEach function is executed with the `this` binding of the composed function.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* functions... - the asynchronous functions to compose\n\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\n// Requires lodash (or underscore), express3 and dresende\'s orm2.\n// Part of an app, that fetches cats of the logged user.\n// This example uses `seq` function to avoid overnesting and error \n// handling clutter.\napp.get(\'/cats\', function(request, response) {\n  function handleError(err, data, callback) {\n    if (err) {\n      console.error(err);\n      response.json({ status: \'error\', message: err.message });\n    }\n    else {\n      callback(data);\n    }\n  }\n  var User = request.models.User;\n  async.seq(\n    _.bind(User.get, User),  // \'User.get\' has signature (id, callback(err, data))\n    handleError,\n    function(user, fn) {\n      user.getCats(fn);      // \'getCats\' has signature (callback(err, data))\n    },\n    handleError,\n    function(cats) {\n      response.json({ status: \'ok\', message: \'Cats found\', data: cats });\n    }\n  )(req.session.user_id);\n  }\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n<a name="applyEach" />\n### applyEach(fns, args..., callback)\n\nApplies the provided arguments to each function in the array, calling \n`callback` after all functions have completed. If you only provide the first\nargument, then it will return a function which lets you pass in the\narguments as if it were a single function call.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `fns` - the asynchronous functions to all call with the same arguments\n* `args...` - any number of separate arguments to pass to the function\n* `callback` - the final argument should be the callback, called when all\n  functions have completed processing\n\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nasync.applyEach([enableSearch, updateSchema], \'bucket\', callback);\n\n// partial application example:\nasync.each(\n    buckets,\n    async.applyEach([enableSearch, updateSchema]),\n    callback\n);\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="applyEachSeries" />\n### applyEachSeries(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nThe same as [`applyEach`](#applyEach) only the functions are applied in series.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="queue" />\n### queue(worker, concurrency)\n\nCreates a `queue` object with the specified `concurrency`. Tasks added to the\n`queue` are processed in parallel (up to the `concurrency` limit). If all\n`worker`s are in progress, the task is queued until one becomes available. \nOnce a `worker` completes a `task`, that `task`\'s callback is called.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `worker(task, callback)` - An asynchronous function for processing a queued\n  task, which must call its `callback(err)` argument when finished, with an \n  optional `error` as an argument.\n* `concurrency` - An `integer` for determining how many `worker` functions should be\n  run in parallel.\n\n__Queue objects__\n\nThe `queue` object returned by this function has the following properties and\nmethods:\n\n* `length()` - a function returning the number of items waiting to be processed.\n* `started` - a function returning whether or not any items have been pushed and processed by the queue\n* `running()` - a function returning the number of items currently being processed.\n* `idle()` - a function returning false if there are items waiting or being processed, or true if not.\n* `concurrency` - an integer for determining how many `worker` functions should be\n  run in parallel. This property can be changed after a `queue` is created to\n  alter the concurrency on-the-fly.\n* `push(task, [callback])` - add a new task to the `queue`. Calls `callback` once \n  the `worker` has finished processing the task. Instead of a single task, a `tasks` array\n  can be submitted. The respective callback is used for every task in the list.\n* `unshift(task, [callback])` - add a new task to the front of the `queue`.\n* `saturated` - a callback that is called when the `queue` length hits the `concurrency` limit, \n   and further tasks will be queued.\n* `empty` - a callback that is called when the last item from the `queue` is given to a `worker`.\n* `drain` - a callback that is called when the last item from the `queue` has returned from the `worker`.\n* `paused` - a boolean for determining whether the queue is in a paused state\n* `pause()` - a function that pauses the processing of tasks until `resume()` is called.\n* `resume()` - a function that resumes the processing of queued tasks when the queue is paused.\n* `kill()` - a function that empties remaining tasks from the queue forcing it to go idle.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\n// create a queue object with concurrency 2\n\nvar q = async.queue(function (task, callback) {\n    console.log(\'hello \' + task.name);\n    callback();\n}, 2);\n\n\n// assign a callback\nq.drain = function() {\n    console.log(\'all items have been processed\');\n}\n\n// add some items to the queue\n\nq.push({name: \'foo\'}, function (err) {\n    console.log(\'finished processing foo\');\n});\nq.push({name: \'bar\'}, function (err) {\n    console.log(\'finished processing bar\');\n});\n\n// add some items to the queue (batch-wise)\n\nq.push([{name: \'baz\'},{name: \'bay\'},{name: \'bax\'}], function (err) {\n    console.log(\'finished processing bar\');\n});\n\n// add some items to the front of the queue\n\nq.unshift({name: \'bar\'}, function (err) {\n    console.log(\'finished processing bar\');\n});\n```\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="priorityQueue" />\n### priorityQueue(worker, concurrency)\n\nThe same as [`queue`](#queue) only tasks are assigned a priority and completed in ascending priority order. There are two differences between `queue` and `priorityQueue` objects:\n\n* `push(task, priority, [callback])` - `priority` should be a number. If an array of\n  `tasks` is given, all tasks will be assigned the same priority.\n* The `unshift` method was removed.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="cargo" />\n### cargo(worker, [payload])\n\nCreates a `cargo` object with the specified payload. Tasks added to the\ncargo will be processed altogether (up to the `payload` limit). If the\n`worker` is in progress, the task is queued until it becomes available. Once\nthe `worker` has completed some tasks, each callback of those tasks is called.\nCheck out [this animation](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/6bbd36f4cf5b35a0f11a96dcd2e97711ffc2fb37/68747470733a2f2f662e636c6f75642e6769746875622e636f6d2f6173736574732f313637363837312f36383130382f62626330636662302d356632392d313165322d393734662d3333393763363464633835382e676966) for how `cargo` and `queue` work.\n\nWhile [queue](#queue) passes only one task to one of a group of workers\nat a time, cargo passes an array of tasks to a single worker, repeating\nwhen the worker is finished.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `worker(tasks, callback)` - An asynchronous function for processing an array of\n  queued tasks, which must call its `callback(err)` argument when finished, with \n  an optional `err` argument.\n* `payload` - An optional `integer` for determining how many tasks should be\n  processed per round; if omitted, the default is unlimited.\n\n__Cargo objects__\n\nThe `cargo` object returned by this function has the following properties and\nmethods:\n\n* `length()` - A function returning the number of items waiting to be processed.\n* `payload` - An `integer` for determining how many tasks should be\n  process per round. This property can be changed after a `cargo` is created to\n  alter the payload on-the-fly.\n* `push(task, [callback])` - Adds `task` to the `queue`. The callback is called\n  once the `worker` has finished processing the task. Instead of a single task, an array of `tasks` \n  can be submitted. The respective callback is used for every task in the list.\n* `saturated` - A callback that is called when the `queue.length()` hits the concurrency and further tasks will be queued.\n* `empty` - A callback that is called when the last item from the `queue` is given to a `worker`.\n* `drain` - A callback that is called when the last item from the `queue` has returned from the `worker`.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\n// create a cargo object with payload 2\n\nvar cargo = async.cargo(function (tasks, callback) {\n    for(var i=0; i<tasks.length; i++){\n      console.log(\'hello \' + tasks[i].name);\n    }\n    callback();\n}, 2);\n\n\n// add some items\n\ncargo.push({name: \'foo\'}, function (err) {\n    console.log(\'finished processing foo\');\n});\ncargo.push({name: \'bar\'}, function (err) {\n    console.log(\'finished processing bar\');\n});\ncargo.push({name: \'baz\'}, function (err) {\n    console.log(\'finished processing baz\');\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="auto" />\n### auto(tasks, [callback])\n\nDetermines the best order for running the functions in `tasks`, based on their \nrequirements. Each function can optionally depend on other functions being completed \nfirst, and each function is run as soon as its requirements are satisfied. \n\nIf any of the functions pass an error to their callback, it will not \ncomplete (so any other functions depending on it will not run), and the main \n`callback` is immediately called with the error. Functions also receive an \nobject containing the results of functions which have completed so far.\n\nNote, all functions are called with a `results` object as a second argument, \nso it is unsafe to pass functions in the `tasks` object which cannot handle the\nextra argument. \n\nFor example, this snippet of code:\n\n```js\nasync.auto({\n  readData: async.apply(fs.readFile, \'data.txt\', \'utf-8\')\n}, callback);\n```\n\nwill have the effect of calling `readFile` with the results object as the last\nargument, which will fail:\n\n```js\nfs.readFile(\'data.txt\', \'utf-8\', cb, {});\n```\n\nInstead, wrap the call to `readFile` in a function which does not forward the \n`results` object:\n\n```js\nasync.auto({\n  readData: function(cb, results){\n    fs.readFile(\'data.txt\', \'utf-8\', cb);\n  }\n}, callback);\n```\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `tasks` - An object. Each of its properties is either a function or an array of\n  requirements, with the function itself the last item in the array. The object\'s key\n  of a property serves as the name of the task defined by that property,\n  i.e. can be used when specifying requirements for other tasks.\n  The function receives two arguments: (1) a `callback(err, result)` which must be \n  called when finished, passing an `error` (which can be `null`) and the result of \n  the function\'s execution, and (2) a `results` object, containing the results of\n  the previously executed functions.\n* `callback(err, results)` - An optional callback which is called when all the\n  tasks have been completed. It receives the `err` argument if any `tasks` \n  pass an error to their callback. Results are always returned; however, if \n  an error occurs, no further `tasks` will be performed, and the results\n  object will only contain partial results.\n\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nasync.auto({\n    get_data: function(callback){\n        console.log(\'in get_data\');\n        // async code to get some data\n        callback(null, \'data\', \'converted to array\');\n    },\n    make_folder: function(callback){\n        console.log(\'in make_folder\');\n        // async code to create a directory to store a file in\n        // this is run at the same time as getting the data\n        callback(null, \'folder\');\n    },\n    write_file: [\'get_data\', \'make_folder\', function(callback, results){\n        console.log(\'in write_file\', JSON.stringify(results));\n        // once there is some data and the directory exists,\n        // write the data to a file in the directory\n        callback(null, \'filename\');\n    }],\n    email_link: [\'write_file\', function(callback, results){\n        console.log(\'in email_link\', JSON.stringify(results));\n        // once the file is written let\'s email a link to it...\n        // results.write_file contains the filename returned by write_file.\n        callback(null, {\'file\':results.write_file, \'email\':\'user@example.com\'});\n    }]\n}, function(err, results) {\n    console.log(\'err = \', err);\n    console.log(\'results = \', results);\n});\n```\n\nThis is a fairly trivial example, but to do this using the basic parallel and\nseries functions would look like this:\n\n```js\nasync.parallel([\n    function(callback){\n        console.log(\'in get_data\');\n        // async code to get some data\n        callback(null, \'data\', \'converted to array\');\n    },\n    function(callback){\n        console.log(\'in make_folder\');\n        // async code to create a directory to store a file in\n        // this is run at the same time as getting the data\n        callback(null, \'folder\');\n    }\n],\nfunction(err, results){\n    async.series([\n        function(callback){\n            console.log(\'in write_file\', JSON.stringify(results));\n            // once there is some data and the directory exists,\n            // write the data to a file in the directory\n            results.push(\'filename\');\n            callback(null);\n        },\n        function(callback){\n            console.log(\'in email_link\', JSON.stringify(results));\n            // once the file is written let\'s email a link to it...\n            callback(null, {\'file\':results.pop(), \'email\':\'user@example.com\'});\n        }\n    ]);\n});\n```\n\nFor a complicated series of `async` tasks, using the [`auto`](#auto) function makes adding\nnew tasks much easier (and the code more readable).\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="retry" />\n### retry([times = 5], task, [callback])\n\nAttempts to get a successful response from `task` no more than `times` times before\nreturning an error. If the task is successful, the `callback` will be passed the result\nof the successfull task. If all attemps fail, the callback will be passed the error and\nresult (if any) of the final attempt.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `times` - An integer indicating how many times to attempt the `task` before giving up. Defaults to 5.\n* `task(callback, results)` - A function which receives two arguments: (1) a `callback(err, result)`\n  which must be called when finished, passing `err` (which can be `null`) and the `result` of \n  the function\'s execution, and (2) a `results` object, containing the results of\n  the previously executed functions (if nested inside another control flow).\n* `callback(err, results)` - An optional callback which is called when the\n  task has succeeded, or after the final failed attempt. It receives the `err` and `result` arguments of the last attempt at completing the `task`.\n\nThe [`retry`](#retry) function can be used as a stand-alone control flow by passing a\ncallback, as shown below:\n\n```js\nasync.retry(3, apiMethod, function(err, result) {\n    // do something with the result\n});\n```\n\nIt can also be embeded within other control flow functions to retry individual methods\nthat are not as reliable, like this:\n\n```js\nasync.auto({\n    users: api.getUsers.bind(api),\n    payments: async.retry(3, api.getPayments.bind(api))\n}, function(err, results) {\n  // do something with the results\n});\n```\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="iterator" />\n### iterator(tasks)\n\nCreates an iterator function which calls the next function in the `tasks` array,\nreturning a continuation to call the next one after that. It\'s also possible to\n“peek” at the next iterator with `iterator.next()`.\n\nThis function is used internally by the `async` module, but can be useful when\nyou want to manually control the flow of functions in series.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `tasks` - An array of functions to run.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nvar iterator = async.iterator([\n    function(){ sys.p(\'one\'); },\n    function(){ sys.p(\'two\'); },\n    function(){ sys.p(\'three\'); }\n]);\n\nnode> var iterator2 = iterator();\n\'one\'\nnode> var iterator3 = iterator2();\n\'two\'\nnode> iterator3();\n\'three\'\nnode> var nextfn = iterator2.next();\nnode> nextfn();\n\'three\'\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="apply" />\n### apply(function, arguments..)\n\nCreates a continuation function with some arguments already applied. \n\nUseful as a shorthand when combined with other control flow functions. Any arguments\npassed to the returned function are added to the arguments originally passed\nto apply.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `function` - The function you want to eventually apply all arguments to.\n* `arguments...` - Any number of arguments to automatically apply when the\n  continuation is called.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\n// using apply\n\nasync.parallel([\n    async.apply(fs.writeFile, \'testfile1\', \'test1\'),\n    async.apply(fs.writeFile, \'testfile2\', \'test2\'),\n]);\n\n\n// the same process without using apply\n\nasync.parallel([\n    function(callback){\n        fs.writeFile(\'testfile1\', \'test1\', callback);\n    },\n    function(callback){\n        fs.writeFile(\'testfile2\', \'test2\', callback);\n    }\n]);\n```\n\nIt\'s possible to pass any number of additional arguments when calling the\ncontinuation:\n\n```js\nnode> var fn = async.apply(sys.puts, \'one\');\nnode> fn(\'two\', \'three\');\none\ntwo\nthree\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="nextTick" />\n### nextTick(callback)\n\nCalls `callback` on a later loop around the event loop. In Node.js this just\ncalls `process.nextTick`; in the browser it falls back to `setImmediate(callback)`\nif available, otherwise `setTimeout(callback, 0)`, which means other higher priority\nevents may precede the execution of `callback`.\n\nThis is used internally for browser-compatibility purposes.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `callback` - The function to call on a later loop around the event loop.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nvar call_order = [];\nasync.nextTick(function(){\n    call_order.push(\'two\');\n    // call_order now equals [\'one\',\'two\']\n});\ncall_order.push(\'one\')\n```\n\n<a name="times" />\n### times(n, callback)\n\nCalls the `callback` function `n` times, and accumulates results in the same manner\nyou would use with [`map`](#map).\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `n` - The number of times to run the function.\n* `callback` - The function to call `n` times.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\n// Pretend this is some complicated async factory\nvar createUser = function(id, callback) {\n  callback(null, {\n    id: \'user\' + id\n  })\n}\n// generate 5 users\nasync.times(5, function(n, next){\n    createUser(n, function(err, user) {\n      next(err, user)\n    })\n}, function(err, users) {\n  // we should now have 5 users\n});\n```\n\n<a name="timesSeries" />\n### timesSeries(n, callback)\n\nThe same as [`times`](#times), only the iterator is applied to each item in `arr` in\nseries. The next `iterator` is only called once the current one has completed. \nThe results array will be in the same order as the original.\n\n\n## Utils\n\n<a name="memoize" />\n### memoize(fn, [hasher])\n\nCaches the results of an `async` function. When creating a hash to store function\nresults against, the callback is omitted from the hash and an optional hash\nfunction can be used.\n\nThe cache of results is exposed as the `memo` property of the function returned\nby `memoize`.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `fn` - The function to proxy and cache results from.\n* `hasher` - Tn optional function for generating a custom hash for storing\n  results. It has all the arguments applied to it apart from the callback, and\n  must be synchronous.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nvar slow_fn = function (name, callback) {\n    // do something\n    callback(null, result);\n};\nvar fn = async.memoize(slow_fn);\n\n// fn can now be used as if it were slow_fn\nfn(\'some name\', function () {\n    // callback\n});\n```\n\n<a name="unmemoize" />\n### unmemoize(fn)\n\nUndoes a [`memoize`](#memoize)d function, reverting it to the original, unmemoized\nform. Handy for testing.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `fn` - the memoized function\n\n<a name="log" />\n### log(function, arguments)\n\nLogs the result of an `async` function to the `console`. Only works in Node.js or\nin browsers that support `console.log` and `console.error` (such as FF and Chrome).\nIf multiple arguments are returned from the async function, `console.log` is\ncalled on each argument in order.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `function` - The function you want to eventually apply all arguments to.\n* `arguments...` - Any number of arguments to apply to the function.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nvar hello = function(name, callback){\n    setTimeout(function(){\n        callback(null, \'hello \' + name);\n    }, 1000);\n};\n```\n```js\nnode> async.log(hello, \'world\');\n\'hello world\'\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="dir" />\n### dir(function, arguments)\n\nLogs the result of an `async` function to the `console` using `console.dir` to\ndisplay the properties of the resulting object. Only works in Node.js or\nin browsers that support `console.dir` and `console.error` (such as FF and Chrome).\nIf multiple arguments are returned from the async function, `console.dir` is\ncalled on each argument in order.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `function` - The function you want to eventually apply all arguments to.\n* `arguments...` - Any number of arguments to apply to the function.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nvar hello = function(name, callback){\n    setTimeout(function(){\n        callback(null, {hello: name});\n    }, 1000);\n};\n```\n```js\nnode> async.dir(hello, \'world\');\n{hello: \'world\'}\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="noConflict" />\n### noConflict()\n\nChanges the value of `async` back to its original value, returning a reference to the\n`async` object.\n',

If none are\nfound, `[str]` is returned.\n\nValid expansions are:\n\n```js\n/^(.*,)+(.+)?$/\n// {a,b,...}\n```\n\nA comma seperated list of options, like `{a,b}` or `{a,{b,c}}` or `{,a,}`.\n\n```js\n/^-?\\d+\\.\\.-?\\d+(\\.\\.-?\\d+)?$/\n// {x..y[..incr]}\n```\n\nA numeric sequence from `x` to `y` inclusive, with optional increment.\nIf `x` or `y` start with a leading `0`, all the numbers will be padded\nto have equal length. Negative numbers and backwards iteration work too.\n\n```js\n/^-?\\d+\\.\\.-?\\d+(\\.\\.-?\\d+)?$/\n// {x..y[..incr]}\n```\n\nAn alphabetic sequence from `x` to `y` inclusive, with optional increment.\n`x` and `y` must be exactly one character, and if given, `incr` must be a\nnumber.\n\nFor compatibility reasons, the string `${` is not eligible for brace expansion.\n\n## Installation\n\nWith [npm](https://npmjs.org) do:\n\n```bash\nnpm install brace-expansion\n```\n\n## Contributors\n\n- [Julian Gruber](https://github.com/juliangruber)\n- [Isaac Z.

8177 silly resolved     readme: '# Async.js\n\n[![Build Status via Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/caolan/async.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/caolan/async)\n\n\nAsync is a utility module which provides straight-forward, powerful functions\nfor working with asynchronous JavaScript. Although originally designed for\nuse with [Node.js](http://nodejs.org), it can also be used directly in the\nbrowser. Also supports [component](https://github.com/component/component).\n\nAsync provides around 20 functions that include the usual \'functional\'\nsuspects (`map`, `reduce`, `filter`, `each`…) as well as some common patterns\nfor asynchronous control flow (`parallel`, `series`, `waterfall`…). All these\nfunctions assume you follow the Node.js convention of providing a single\ncallback as the last argument of your `async` function.\n\n\n## Quick Examples\n\n```javascript\nasync.map([\'file1\',\'file2\',\'file3\'], fs.stat, function(err, results){\n    // results is now an array of stats for each file\n});\n\nasync.filter([\'file1\',\'file2\',\'file3\'], fs.exists, function(results){\n    // results now equals an array of the existing files\n});\n\nasync.parallel([\n    function(){ ... },\n    function(){ ... }\n], callback);\n\nasync.series([\n    function(){ ... },\n    function(){ ... }\n]);\n```\n\nThere are many more functions available so take a look at the docs below for a\nfull list. This module aims to be comprehensive, so if you feel anything is\nmissing please create a GitHub issue for it.\n\n## Common Pitfalls\n\n### Binding a context to an iterator\n\nThis section is really about `bind`, not about `async`. If you are wondering how to\nmake `async` execute your iterators in a given context, or are confused as to why\na method of another library isn\'t working as an iterator, study this example:\n\n```js\n// Here is a simple object with an (unnecessarily roundabout) squaring method\nvar AsyncSquaringLibrary = {\n  squareExponent: 2,\n  square: function(number, callback){ \n    var result = Math.pow(number, this.squareExponent);\n    setTimeout(function(){\n      callback(null, result);\n    }, 200);\n  }\n};\n\nasync.map([1, 2, 3], AsyncSquaringLibrary.square, function(err, result){\n  // result is [NaN, NaN, NaN]\n  // This fails because the `this.squareExponent` expression in the square\n  // function is not evaluated in the context of AsyncSquaringLibrary, and is\n  // therefore undefined.\n});\n\nasync.map([1, 2, 3], AsyncSquaringLibrary.square.bind(AsyncSquaringLibrary), function(err, result){\n  // result is [1, 4, 9]\n  // With the help of bind we can attach a context to the iterator before\n  // passing it to async. Now the square function will be executed in its \n  // \'home\' AsyncSquaringLibrary context and the value of `this.squareExponent`\n  // will be as expected.\n});\n```\n\n## Download\n\nThe source is available for download from\n[GitHub](http://github.com/caolan/async).\nAlternatively, you can install using Node Package Manager (`npm`):\n\n    npm install async\n\n__Development:__ [async.js](https://github.com/caolan/async/raw/master/lib/async.js) - 29.6kb Uncompressed\n\n## In the Browser\n\nSo far it\'s been tested in IE6, IE7, IE8, FF3.6 and Chrome 5. \n\nUsage:\n\n```html\n<script type="text/javascript" src="async.js"></script>\n<script type="text/javascript">\n\n    async.map(data, asyncProcess, function(err, results){\n        alert(results);\n    });\n\n</script>\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\n### Collections\n\n* [`each`](#each)\n* [`eachSeries`](#eachSeries)\n* [`eachLimit`](#eachLimit)\n* [`map`](#map)\n* [`mapSeries`](#mapSeries)\n* [`mapLimit`](#mapLimit)\n* [`filter`](#filter)\n* [`filterSeries`](#filterSeries)\n* [`reject`](#reject)\n* [`rejectSeries`](#rejectSeries)\n* [`reduce`](#reduce)\n* [`reduceRight`](#reduceRight)\n* [`detect`](#detect)\n* [`detectSeries`](#detectSeries)\n* [`sortBy`](#sortBy)\n* [`some`](#some)\n* [`every`](#every)\n* [`concat`](#concat)\n* [`concatSeries`](#concatSeries)\n\n### Control Flow\n\n* [`series`](#seriestasks-callback)\n* [`parallel`](#parallel)\n* [`parallelLimit`](#parallellimittasks-limit-callback)\n* [`whilst`](#whilst)\n* [`doWhilst`](#doWhilst)\n* [`until`](#until)\n* [`doUntil`](#doUntil)\n* [`forever`](#forever)\n* [`waterfall`](#waterfall)\n* [`compose`](#compose)\n* [`seq`](#seq)\n* [`applyEach`](#applyEach)\n* [`applyEachSeries`](#applyEachSeries)\n* [`queue`](#queue)\n* [`priorityQueue`](#priorityQueue)\n* [`cargo`](#cargo)\n* [`auto`](#auto)\n* [`retry`](#retry)\n* [`iterator`](#iterator)\n* [`apply`](#apply)\n* [`nextTick`](#nextTick)\n* [`times`](#times)\n* [`timesSeries`](#timesSeries)\n\n### Utils\n\n* [`memoize`](#memoize)\n* [`unmemoize`](#unmemoize)\n* [`log`](#log)\n* [`dir`](#dir)\n* [`noConflict`](#noConflict)\n\n\n## Collections\n\n<a name="forEach" />\n<a name="each" />\n### each(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nApplies the function `iterator` to each item in `arr`, in parallel.\nThe `iterator` is called with an item from the list, and a callback for when it\nhas finished. If the `iterator` passes an error to its `callback`, the main\n`callback` (for the `each` function) is immediately called with the error.\n\nNote, that since this function applies `iterator` to each item in parallel,\nthere is no guarantee that the iterator functions will complete in order.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `arr` - An array to iterate over.\n* `iterator(item, callback)` - A function to apply to each item in `arr`.\n  The iterator is passed a `callback(err)` which must be called once it has \n  completed. If no error has occured, the `callback` should be run without \n  arguments or with an explicit `null` argument.\n* `callback(err)` - A callback which is called when all `iterator` functions\n  have finished, or an error occurs.\n\n__Examples__\n\n\n```js\n// assuming openFiles is an array of file names and saveFile is a function\n// to save the modified contents of that file:\n\nasync.each(openFiles, saveFile, function(err){\n    // if any of the saves produced an error, err would equal that error\n});\n```\n\n```js\n// assuming openFiles is an array of file names \n\nasync.each(openFiles, function( file, callback) {\n  \n  // Perform operation on file here.\n  console.log(\'Processing file \' + file);\n  \n  if( file.length > 32 ) {\n    console.log(\'This file name is too long\');\n    callback(\'File name too long\');\n  } else {\n    // Do work to process file here\n    console.log(\'File processed\');\n    callback();\n  }\n}, function(err){\n    // if any of the file processing produced an error, err would equal that error\n    if( err ) {\n      // One of the iterations produced an error.\n      // All processing will now stop.\n      console.log(\'A file failed to process\');\n    } else {\n      console.log(\'All files have been processed successfully\');\n    }\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="forEachSeries" />\n<a name="eachSeries" />\n### eachSeries(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nThe same as [`each`](#each), only `iterator` is applied to each item in `arr` in\nseries. The next `iterator` is only called once the current one has completed. \nThis means the `iterator` functions will complete in order.\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="forEachLimit" />\n<a name="eachLimit" />\n### eachLimit(arr, limit, iterator, callback)\n\nThe same as [`each`](#each), only no more than `limit` `iterator`s will be simultaneously \nrunning at any time.\n\nNote that the items in `arr` are not processed in batches, so there is no guarantee that \nthe first `limit` `iterator` functions will complete before any others are started.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `arr` - An array to iterate over.\n* `limit` - The maximum number of `iterator`s to run at any time.\n* `iterator(item, callback)` - A function to apply to each item in `arr`.\n  The iterator is passed a `callback(err)` which must be called once it has \n  completed. If no error has occured, the callback should be run without \n  arguments or with an explicit `null` argument.\n* `callback(err)` - A callback which is called when all `iterator` functions\n  have finished, or an error occurs.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\n// Assume documents is an array of JSON objects and requestApi is a\n// function that interacts with a rate-limited REST api.\n\nasync.eachLimit(documents, 20, requestApi, function(err){\n    // if any of the saves produced an error, err would equal that error\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="map" />\n### map(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nProduces a new array of values by mapping each value in `arr` through\nthe `iterator` function. The `iterator` is called with an item from `arr` and a\ncallback for when it has finished processing. Each of these callback takes 2 arguments: \nan `error`, and the transformed item from `arr`. If `iterator` passes an error to this \ncallback, the main `callback` (for the `map` function) is immediately called with the error.\n\nNote, that since this function applies the `iterator` to each item in parallel,\nthere is no guarantee that the `iterator` functions will complete in order. \nHowever, the results array will be in the same order as the original `arr`.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `arr` - An array to iterate over.\n* `iterator(item, callback)` - A function to apply to each item in `arr`.\n  The iterator is passed a `callback(err, transformed)` which must be called once \n  it has completed with an error (which can be `null`) and a transformed item.\n* `callback(err, results)` - A callback which is called when all `iterator`\n  functions have finished, or an error occurs. Results is an array of the\n  transformed items from the `arr`.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nasync.map([\'file1\',\'file2\',\'file3\'], fs.stat, function(err, results){\n    // results is now an array of stats for each file\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="mapSeries" />\n### mapSeries(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nThe same as [`map`](#map), only the `iterator` is applied to each item in `arr` in\nseries. The next `iterator` is only called once the current one has completed. \nThe results array will be in the same order as the original.\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="mapLimit" />\n### mapLimit(arr, limit, iterator, callback)\n\nThe same as [`map`](#map), only no more than `limit` `iterator`s will be simultaneously \nrunning at any time.\n\nNote that the items are not processed in batches, so there is no guarantee that \nthe first `limit` `iterator` functions will complete before any others are started.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `arr` - An array to iterate over.\n* `limit` - The maximum number of `iterator`s to run at any time.\n* `iterator(item, callback)` - A function to apply to each item in `arr`.\n  The iterator is passed a `callback(err, transformed)` which must be called once \n  it has completed with an error (which can be `null`) and a transformed item.\n* `callback(err, results)` - A callback which is called when all `iterator`\n  calls have finished, or an error occurs. The result is an array of the\n  transformed items from the original `arr`.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nasync.mapLimit([\'file1\',\'file2\',\'file3\'], 1, fs.stat, function(err, results){\n    // results is now an array of stats for each file\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="select" />\n<a name="filter" />\n### filter(arr, iterator, callback)\n\n__Alias:__ `select`\n\nReturns a new array of all the values in `arr` which pass an async truth test.\n_The callback for each `iterator` call only accepts a single argument of `true` or\n`false`; it does not accept an error argument first!_ This is in-line with the\nway node libraries work with truth tests like `fs.exists`.

The `iterator` is passed a\n  `callback(err, reduction)` which accepts an optional error as its first \n  argument, and the state of the reduction as the second. If an error is \n  passed to the callback, the reduction is stopped and the main `callback` is \n  immediately called with the error.\n* `callback(err, result)` - A callback which is called after all the `iterator`\n  functions have finished. Result is the reduced value.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nasync.reduce([1,2,3], 0, function(memo, item, callback){\n    // pointless async:\n    process.nextTick(function(){\n        callback(null, memo + item)\n    });\n}, function(err, result){\n    // result is now equal to the last value of memo, which is 6\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="reduceRight" />\n### reduceRight(arr, memo, iterator, callback)\n\n__Alias:__ `foldr`\n\nSame as [`reduce`](#reduce), only operates on `arr` in reverse order.\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="detect" />\n### detect(arr, iterator, callback)\n\nReturns the first value in `arr` that passes an async truth test.

If all\n`worker`s are in progress, the task is queued until one becomes available. \nOnce a `worker` completes a `task`, that `task`\'s callback is called.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `worker(task, callback)` - An asynchronous function for processing a queued\n  task, which must call its `callback(err)` argument when finished, with an \n  optional `error` as an argument.\n* `concurrency` - An `integer` for determining how many `worker` functions should be\n  run in parallel.\n\n__Queue objects__\n\nThe `queue` object returned by this function has the following properties and\nmethods:\n\n* `length()` - a function returning the number of items waiting to be processed.\n* `started` - a function returning whether or not any items have been pushed and processed by the queue\n* `running()` - a function returning the number of items currently being processed.\n* `idle()` - a function returning false if there are items waiting or being processed, or true if not.\n* `concurrency` - an integer for determining how many `worker` functions should be\n  run in parallel. This property can be changed after a `queue` is created to\n  alter the concurrency on-the-fly.\n* `push(task, [callback])` - add a new task to the `queue`. Calls `callback` once \n  the `worker` has finished processing the task. Instead of a single task, a `tasks` array\n  can be submitted. The respective callback is used for every task in the list.\n* `unshift(task, [callback])` - add a new task to the front of the `queue`.\n* `saturated` - a callback that is called when the `queue` length hits the `concurrency` limit, \n   and further tasks will be queued.\n* `empty` - a callback that is called when the last item from the `queue` is given to a `worker`.\n* `drain` - a callback that is called when the last item from the `queue` has returned from the `worker`.\n* `paused` - a boolean for determining whether the queue is in a paused state\n* `pause()` - a function that pauses the processing of tasks until `resume()` is called.\n* `resume()` - a function that resumes the processing of queued tasks when the queue is paused.\n* `kill()` - a function that empties remaining tasks from the queue forcing it to go idle.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\n// create a queue object with concurrency 2\n\nvar q = async.queue(function (task, callback) {\n    console.log(\'hello \' + task.name);\n    callback();\n}, 2);\n\n\n// assign a callback\nq.drain = function() {\n    console.log(\'all items have been processed\');\n}\n\n// add some items to the queue\n\nq.push({name: \'foo\'}, function (err) {\n    console.log(\'finished processing foo\');\n});\nq.push({name: \'bar\'}, function (err) {\n    console.log(\'finished processing bar\');\n});\n\n// add some items to the queue (batch-wise)\n\nq.push([{name: \'baz\'},{name: \'bay\'},{name: \'bax\'}], function (err) {\n    console.log(\'finished processing bar\');\n});\n\n// add some items to the front of the queue\n\nq.unshift({name: \'bar\'}, function (err) {\n    console.log(\'finished processing bar\');\n});\n```\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="priorityQueue" />\n### priorityQueue(worker, concurrency)\n\nThe same as [`queue`](#queue) only tasks are assigned a priority and completed in ascending priority order. There are two differences between `queue` and `priorityQueue` objects:\n\n* `push(task, priority, [callback])` - `priority` should be a number. If an array of\n  `tasks` is given, all tasks will be assigned the same priority.\n* The `unshift` method was removed.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="cargo" />\n### cargo(worker, [payload])\n\nCreates a `cargo` object with the specified payload. Tasks added to the\ncargo will be processed altogether (up to the `payload` limit). If the\n`worker` is in progress, the task is queued until it becomes available. Once\nthe `worker` has completed some tasks, each callback of those tasks is called.\nCheck out [this animation](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/6bbd36f4cf5b35a0f11a96dcd2e97711ffc2fb37/68747470733a2f2f662e636c6f75642e6769746875622e636f6d2f6173736574732f313637363837312f36383130382f62626330636662302d356632392d313165322d393734662d3333393763363464633835382e676966) for how `cargo` and `queue` work.\n\nWhile [queue](#queue) passes only one task to one of a group of workers\nat a time, cargo passes an array of tasks to a single worker, repeating\nwhen the worker is finished.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `worker(tasks, callback)` - An asynchronous function for processing an array of\n  queued tasks, which must call its `callback(err)` argument when finished, with \n  an optional `err` argument.\n* `payload` - An optional `integer` for determining how many tasks should be\n  processed per round; if omitted, the default is unlimited.\n\n__Cargo objects__\n\nThe `cargo` object returned by this function has the following properties and\nmethods:\n\n* `length()` - A function returning the number of items waiting to be processed.\n* `payload` - An `integer` for determining how many tasks should be\n  process per round. This property can be changed after a `cargo` is created to\n  alter the payload on-the-fly.\n* `push(task, [callback])` - Adds `task` to the `queue`. The callback is called\n  once the `worker` has finished processing the task. Instead of a single task, an array of `tasks` \n  can be submitted. The respective callback is used for every task in the list.\n* `saturated` - A callback that is called when the `queue.length()` hits the concurrency and further tasks will be queued.\n* `empty` - A callback that is called when the last item from the `queue` is given to a `worker`.\n* `drain` - A callback that is called when the last item from the `queue` has returned from the `worker`.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\n// create a cargo object with payload 2\n\nvar cargo = async.cargo(function (tasks, callback) {\n    for(var i=0; i<tasks.length; i++){\n      console.log(\'hello \' + tasks[i].name);\n    }\n    callback();\n}, 2);\n\n\n// add some items\n\ncargo.push({name: \'foo\'}, function (err) {\n    console.log(\'finished processing foo\');\n});\ncargo.push({name: \'bar\'}, function (err) {\n    console.log(\'finished processing bar\');\n});\ncargo.push({name: \'baz\'}, function (err) {\n    console.log(\'finished processing baz\');\n});\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="auto" />\n### auto(tasks, [callback])\n\nDetermines the best order for running the functions in `tasks`, based on their \nrequirements. Each function can optionally depend on other functions being completed \nfirst, and each function is run as soon as its requirements are satisfied. \n\nIf any of the functions pass an error to their callback, it will not \ncomplete (so any other functions depending on it will not run), and the main \n`callback` is immediately called with the error. Functions also receive an \nobject containing the results of functions which have completed so far.\n\nNote, all functions are called with a `results` object as a second argument, \nso it is unsafe to pass functions in the `tasks` object which cannot handle the\nextra argument. \n\nFor example, this snippet of code:\n\n```js\nasync.auto({\n  readData: async.apply(fs.readFile, \'data.txt\', \'utf-8\')\n}, callback);\n```\n\nwill have the effect of calling `readFile` with the results object as the last\nargument, which will fail:\n\n```js\nfs.readFile(\'data.txt\', \'utf-8\', cb, {});\n```\n\nInstead, wrap the call to `readFile` in a function which does not forward the \n`results` object:\n\n```js\nasync.auto({\n  readData: function(cb, results){\n    fs.readFile(\'data.txt\', \'utf-8\', cb);\n  }\n}, callback);\n```\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `tasks` - An object. Each of its properties is either a function or an array of\n  requirements, with the function itself the last item in the array. The object\'s key\n  of a property serves as the name of the task defined by that property,\n  i.e. can be used when specifying requirements for other tasks.\n  The function receives two arguments: (1) a `callback(err, result)` which must be \n  called when finished, passing an `error` (which can be `null`) and the result of \n  the function\'s execution, and (2) a `results` object, containing the results of\n  the previously executed functions.\n* `callback(err, results)` - An optional callback which is called when all the\n  tasks have been completed. It receives the `err` argument if any `tasks` \n  pass an error to their callback. Results are always returned; however, if \n  an error occurs, no further `tasks` will be performed, and the results\n  object will only contain partial results.\n\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nasync.auto({\n    get_data: function(callback){\n        console.log(\'in get_data\');\n        // async code to get some data\n        callback(null, \'data\', \'converted to array\');\n    },\n    make_folder: function(callback){\n        console.log(\'in make_folder\');\n        // async code to create a directory to store a file in\n        // this is run at the same time as getting the data\n        callback(null, \'folder\');\n    },\n    write_file: [\'get_data\', \'make_folder\', function(callback, results){\n        console.log(\'in write_file\', JSON.stringify(results));\n        // once there is some data and the directory exists,\n        // write the data to a file in the directory\n        callback(null, \'filename\');\n    }],\n    email_link: [\'write_file\', function(callback, results){\n        console.log(\'in email_link\', JSON.stringify(results));\n        // once the file is written let\'s email a link to it...\n        // results.write_file contains the filename returned by write_file.\n        callback(null, {\'file\':results.write_file, \'email\':\'user@example.com\'});\n    }]\n}, function(err, results) {\n    console.log(\'err = \', err);\n    console.log(\'results = \', results);\n});\n```\n\nThis is a fairly trivial example, but to do this using the basic parallel and\nseries functions would look like this:\n\n```js\nasync.parallel([\n    function(callback){\n        console.log(\'in get_data\');\n        // async code to get some data\n        callback(null, \'data\', \'converted to array\');\n    },\n    function(callback){\n        console.log(\'in make_folder\');\n        // async code to create a directory to store a file in\n        // this is run at the same time as getting the data\n        callback(null, \'folder\');\n    }\n],\nfunction(err, results){\n    async.series([\n        function(callback){\n            console.log(\'in write_file\', JSON.stringify(results));\n            // once there is some data and the directory exists,\n            // write the data to a file in the directory\n            results.push(\'filename\');\n            callback(null);\n        },\n        function(callback){\n            console.log(\'in email_link\', JSON.stringify(results));\n            // once the file is written let\'s email a link to it...\n            callback(null, {\'file\':results.pop(), \'email\':\'user@example.com\'});\n        }\n    ]);\n});\n```\n\nFor a complicated series of `async` tasks, using the [`auto`](#auto) function makes adding\nnew tasks much easier (and the code more readable).\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="retry" />\n### retry([times = 5], task, [callback])\n\nAttempts to get a successful response from `task` no more than `times` times before\nreturning an error. If the task is successful, the `callback` will be passed the result\nof the successfull task. If all attemps fail, the callback will be passed the error and\nresult (if any) of the final attempt.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `times` - An integer indicating how many times to attempt the `task` before giving up. Defaults to 5.\n* `task(callback, results)` - A function which receives two arguments: (1) a `callback(err, result)`\n  which must be called when finished, passing `err` (which can be `null`) and the `result` of \n  the function\'s execution, and (2) a `results` object, containing the results of\n  the previously executed functions (if nested inside another control flow).\n* `callback(err, results)` - An optional callback which is called when the\n  task has succeeded, or after the final failed attempt. It receives the `err` and `result` arguments of the last attempt at completing the `task`.\n\nThe [`retry`](#retry) function can be used as a stand-alone control flow by passing a\ncallback, as shown below:\n\n```js\nasync.retry(3, apiMethod, function(err, result) {\n    // do something with the result\n});\n```\n\nIt can also be embeded within other control flow functions to retry individual methods\nthat are not as reliable, like this:\n\n```js\nasync.auto({\n    users: api.getUsers.bind(api),\n    payments: async.retry(3, api.getPayments.bind(api))\n}, function(err, results) {\n  // do something with the results\n});\n```\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="iterator" />\n### iterator(tasks)\n\nCreates an iterator function which calls the next function in the `tasks` array,\nreturning a continuation to call the next one after that. It\'s also possible to\n“peek” at the next iterator with `iterator.next()`.\n\nThis function is used internally by the `async` module, but can be useful when\nyou want to manually control the flow of functions in series.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `tasks` - An array of functions to run.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nvar iterator = async.iterator([\n    function(){ sys.p(\'one\'); },\n    function(){ sys.p(\'two\'); },\n    function(){ sys.p(\'three\'); }\n]);\n\nnode> var iterator2 = iterator();\n\'one\'\nnode> var iterator3 = iterator2();\n\'two\'\nnode> iterator3();\n\'three\'\nnode> var nextfn = iterator2.next();\nnode> nextfn();\n\'three\'\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="apply" />\n### apply(function, arguments..)\n\nCreates a continuation function with some arguments already applied. \n\nUseful as a shorthand when combined with other control flow functions. Any arguments\npassed to the returned function are added to the arguments originally passed\nto apply.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `function` - The function you want to eventually apply all arguments to.\n* `arguments...` - Any number of arguments to automatically apply when the\n  continuation is called.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\n// using apply\n\nasync.parallel([\n    async.apply(fs.writeFile, \'testfile1\', \'test1\'),\n    async.apply(fs.writeFile, \'testfile2\', \'test2\'),\n]);\n\n\n// the same process without using apply\n\nasync.parallel([\n    function(callback){\n        fs.writeFile(\'testfile1\', \'test1\', callback);\n    },\n    function(callback){\n        fs.writeFile(\'testfile2\', \'test2\', callback);\n    }\n]);\n```\n\nIt\'s possible to pass any number of additional arguments when calling the\ncontinuation:\n\n```js\nnode> var fn = async.apply(sys.puts, \'one\');\nnode> fn(\'two\', \'three\');\none\ntwo\nthree\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="nextTick" />\n### nextTick(callback)\n\nCalls `callback` on a later loop around the event loop. In Node.js this just\ncalls `process.nextTick`; in the browser it falls back to `setImmediate(callback)`\nif available, otherwise `setTimeout(callback, 0)`, which means other higher priority\nevents may precede the execution of `callback`.\n\nThis is used internally for browser-compatibility purposes.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `callback` - The function to call on a later loop around the event loop.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nvar call_order = [];\nasync.nextTick(function(){\n    call_order.push(\'two\');\n    // call_order now equals [\'one\',\'two\']\n});\ncall_order.push(\'one\')\n```\n\n<a name="times" />\n### times(n, callback)\n\nCalls the `callback` function `n` times, and accumulates results in the same manner\nyou would use with [`map`](#map).\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `n` - The number of times to run the function.\n* `callback` - The function to call `n` times.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\n// Pretend this is some complicated async factory\nvar createUser = function(id, callback) {\n  callback(null, {\n    id: \'user\' + id\n  })\n}\n// generate 5 users\nasync.times(5, function(n, next){\n    createUser(n, function(err, user) {\n      next(err, user)\n    })\n}, function(err, users) {\n  // we should now have 5 users\n});\n```\n\n<a name="timesSeries" />\n### timesSeries(n, callback)\n\nThe same as [`times`](#times), only the iterator is applied to each item in `arr` in\nseries. The next `iterator` is only called once the current one has completed. \nThe results array will be in the same order as the original.\n\n\n## Utils\n\n<a name="memoize" />\n### memoize(fn, [hasher])\n\nCaches the results of an `async` function. When creating a hash to store function\nresults against, the callback is omitted from the hash and an optional hash\nfunction can be used.\n\nThe cache of results is exposed as the `memo` property of the function returned\nby `memoize`.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `fn` - The function to proxy and cache results from.\n* `hasher` - Tn optional function for generating a custom hash for storing\n  results. It has all the arguments applied to it apart from the callback, and\n  must be synchronous.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nvar slow_fn = function (name, callback) {\n    // do something\n    callback(null, result);\n};\nvar fn = async.memoize(slow_fn);\n\n// fn can now be used as if it were slow_fn\nfn(\'some name\', function () {\n    // callback\n});\n```\n\n<a name="unmemoize" />\n### unmemoize(fn)\n\nUndoes a [`memoize`](#memoize)d function, reverting it to the original, unmemoized\nform. Handy for testing.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `fn` - the memoized function\n\n<a name="log" />\n### log(function, arguments)\n\nLogs the result of an `async` function to the `console`. Only works in Node.js or\nin browsers that support `console.log` and `console.error` (such as FF and Chrome).\nIf multiple arguments are returned from the async function, `console.log` is\ncalled on each argument in order.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `function` - The function you want to eventually apply all arguments to.\n* `arguments...` - Any number of arguments to apply to the function.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nvar hello = function(name, callback){\n    setTimeout(function(){\n        callback(null, \'hello \' + name);\n    }, 1000);\n};\n```\n```js\nnode> async.log(hello, \'world\');\n\'hello world\'\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="dir" />\n### dir(function, arguments)\n\nLogs the result of an `async` function to the `console` using `console.dir` to\ndisplay the properties of the resulting object. Only works in Node.js or\nin browsers that support `console.dir` and `console.error` (such as FF and Chrome).\nIf multiple arguments are returned from the async function, `console.dir` is\ncalled on each argument in order.\n\n__Arguments__\n\n* `function` - The function you want to eventually apply all arguments to.\n* `arguments...` - Any number of arguments to apply to the function.\n\n__Example__\n\n```js\nvar hello = function(name, callback){\n    setTimeout(function(){\n        callback(null, {hello: name});\n    }, 1000);\n};\n```\n```js\nnode> async.dir(hello, \'world\');\n{hello: \'world\'}\n```\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n<a name="noConflict" />\n### noConflict()\n\nChanges the value of `async` back to its original value, returning a reference to the\n`async` object.\n',

8408 silly resolved     readme: '# delayed-stream\n\nBuffers events from a stream until you are ready to handle them.\n\n## Installation\n\n``` bash\nnpm install delayed-stream\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nThe following example shows how to write a http echo server that delays its\nresponse by 1000 ms.\n\n``` javascript\nvar DelayedStream = require(\'delayed-stream\');\nvar http = require(\'http\');\n\nhttp.createServer(function(req, res) {\n  var delayed = DelayedStream.create(req);\n\n  setTimeout(function() {\n    res.writeHead(200);\n    delayed.pipe(res);\n  }, 1000);\n});\n```\n\nIf you are not using `Stream#pipe`, you can also manually release the buffered\nevents by calling `delayedStream.resume()`:\n\n``` javascript\nvar delayed = DelayedStream.create(req);\n\nsetTimeout(function() {\n  // Emit all buffered events and resume underlaying source\n  delayed.resume();\n}, 1000);\n```\n\n## Implementation\n\nIn order to use this meta stream properly, here are a few things you should\nknow about the implementation.\n\n### Event Buffering / Proxying\n\nAll events of the `source` stream are hijacked by overwriting the `source.emit`\nmethod. Until node implements a catch-all event listener, this is the only way.\n\nHowever, delayed-stream still continues to emit all events it captures on the\n`source`, regardless of whether you have released the delayed stream yet or\nnot.\n\nUpon creation, delayed-stream captures all `source` events and stores them in\nan internal event buffer. Once `delayedStream.release()` is called, all\nbuffered events are emitted on the `delayedStream`, and the event buffer is\ncleared. After that, delayed-stream merely acts as a proxy for the underlaying\nsource.\n\n### Error handling\n\nError events on `source` are buffered / proxied just like any other events.\nHowever, `delayedStream.create` attaches a no-op `\'error\'` listener to the\n`source`. This way you only have to handle errors on the `delayedStream`\nobject, rather than in two places.\n\n### Buffer limits\n\ndelayed-stream provides a `maxDataSize` property that can be used to limit\nthe amount of data being buffered. In order to protect you from bad `source`\nstreams that don\'t react to `source.pause()`, this feature is enabled by\ndefault.\n\n## API\n\n### DelayedStream.create(source, [options])\n\nReturns a new `delayedStream`. Available options are:\n\n* `pauseStream`\n* `maxDataSize`\n\nThe description for those properties can be found below.\n\n### delayedStream.source\n\nThe `source` stream managed by this object. This is useful if you are\npassing your `delayedStream` around, and you still want to access properties\non the `source` object.\n\n### delayedStream.pauseStream = true\n\nWhether to pause the underlaying `source` when calling\n`DelayedStream.create()`. Modifying this property afterwards has no effect.\n\n### delayedStream.maxDataSize = 1024 * 1024\n\nThe amount of data to buffer before emitting an `error`.\n\nIf the underlaying source is emitting `Buffer` objects, the `maxDataSize`\nrefers to bytes.\n\nIf the underlaying source is emitting JavaScript strings, the size refers to\ncharacters.\n\nIf you know what you are doing, you can set this property to `Infinity` to\ndisable this feature. You can also modify this property during runtime.\n\n### delayedStream.maxDataSize = 1024 * 1024\n\nThe amount of data to buffer before emitting an `error`.\n\nIf the underlaying source is emitting `Buffer` objects, the `maxDataSize`\nrefers to bytes.\n\nIf the underlaying source is emitting JavaScript strings, the size refers to\ncharacters.\n\nIf you know what you are doing, you can set this property to `Infinity` to\ndisable this feature.\n\n### delayedStream.dataSize = 0\n\nThe amount of data buffered so far.\n\n### delayedStream.readable\n\nAn ECMA5 getter that returns the value of `source.readable`.\n\n### delayedStream.resume()\n\nIf the `delayedStream` has not been released so far, `delayedStream.release()`\nis called.\n\nIn either case, `source.resume()` is called.\n\n### delayedStream.pause()\n\nCalls `source.pause()`.\n\n### delayedStream.pipe(dest)\n\nCalls `delayedStream.resume()` and then proxies the arguments to `source.pipe`.\n\n### delayedStream.release()\n\nEmits and clears all events that have been buffered up so far. This does not\nresume the underlaying source, use `delayedStream.resume()` instead.\n\n## License\n\ndelayed-stream is licensed under the MIT license.\n',

The former tracks the Streams2 implementation in Node 0.10, including bug-fixes and minor improvements as they are added. The latter tracks Streams3 as it develops in Node 0.11; we will likely see a v1.2.x branch for Node 0.12.\n\n**readable-stream** uses proper patch-level versioning so if you pin to `"~1.0.0"` you’ll get the latest Node 0.10 Streams2 implementation, including any fixes and minor non-breaking improvements. The patch-level versions of 1.0.x and 1.1.x should mirror the patch-level versions of Node-core releases. You should prefer the **1.0.x** releases for now and when you’re ready to start using Streams3, pin to `"~1.1.0"`\n\n',

The community registration procedure is outlined in\n[RFC 6838 section 5](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6838#section-5). Types\nregistered with the IANA are automatically pulled into this library.\n\n[npm-version-image]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/mime-db.svg?style=flat\n[npm-downloads-image]: https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/mime-db.svg?style=flat\n[npm-url]: https://npmjs.org/package/mime-db\n[travis-image]: https://img.shields.io/travis/jshttp/mime-db.svg?style=flat\n[travis-url]: https://travis-ci.org/jshttp/mime-db\n[coveralls-image]: https://img.shields.io/coveralls/jshttp/mime-db.svg?style=flat\n[coveralls-url]: https://coveralls.io/r/jshttp/mime-db?branch=master\n[node-image]: https://img.shields.io/node/v/mime-db.svg?style=flat\n[node-url]: http://nodejs.org/download/\n',

Only the Punycoded parts of the input will be converted, i.e. it doesn’t matter if you call it on a string that has already been converted to Unicode.\n\n```js\n// decode domain names\npunycode.toUnicode(\'xn--maana-pta.com\');\n// → \'mañana.com\'\npunycode.toUnicode(\'xn----dqo34k.com\');\n// → \'☃-⌘.com\'\n\n// decode email addresses\npunycode.toUnicode(\'джумла@xn--p-8sbkgc5ag7bhce.xn--ba-lmcq\');\n// → \'джумла@джpумлатест.bрфa\'\n```\n\n### `punycode.toASCII(input)`\n\nConverts a Unicode string representing a domain name or an email address to Punycode. Only the non-ASCII parts of the input will be converted, i.e. it doesn’t matter if you call it with a domain that\'s already in ASCII.\n\n```js\n// encode domain names\npunycode.toASCII(\'mañana.com\');\n// → \'xn--maana-pta.com\'\npunycode.toASCII(\'☃-⌘.com\');\n// → \'xn----dqo34k.com\'\n\n// encode email addresses\npunycode.toASCII(\'джумла@джpумлатест.bрфa\');\n// → \'джумла@xn--p-8sbkgc5ag7bhce.xn--ba-lmcq\'\n```\n\n### `punycode.ucs2`\n\n#### `punycode.ucs2.decode(string)`\n\nCreates an array containing the numeric code point values of each Unicode symbol in the string. While [JavaScript uses UCS-2 internally](https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/javascript-encoding), this function will convert a pair of surrogate halves (each of which UCS-2 exposes as separate characters) into a single code point, matching UTF-16.\n\n```js\npunycode.ucs2.decode(\'abc\');\n// → [0x61, 0x62, 0x63]\n// surrogate pair for U+1D306 TETRAGRAM FOR CENTRE:\npunycode.ucs2.decode(\'\\uD834\\uDF06\');\n// → [0x1D306]\n```\n\n#### `punycode.ucs2.encode(codePoints)`\n\nCreates a string based on an array of numeric code point values.\n\n```js\npunycode.ucs2.encode([0x61, 0x62, 0x63]);\n// → \'abc\'\npunycode.ucs2.encode([0x1D306]);\n// → \'\\uD834\\uDF06\'\n```\n\n### `punycode.version`\n\nA string representing the current Punycode.js version number.\n\n## Unit tests & code coverage\n\nAfter cloning this repository, run `npm install --dev` to install the dependencies needed for Punycode.js development and testing. You may want to install Istanbul _globally_ using `npm install istanbul -g`.\n\nOnce that’s done, you can run the unit tests in Node using `npm test` or `node tests/tests.js`. To run the tests in Rhino, Ringo, Narwhal, PhantomJS, and web browsers as well, use `grunt test`.\n\nTo generate the code coverage report, use `grunt cover`.\n\nFeel free to fork if you see possible improvements!\n\n## Author\n\n| [![twitter/mathias](https://gravatar.com/avatar/24e08a9ea84deb17ae121074d0f17125?s=70)](https://twitter.com/mathias "Follow @mathias on Twitter") |\n|---|\n| [Mathias Bynens](https://mathiasbynens.be/) |\n\n## Contributors\n\n| [![twitter/jdalton](https://gravatar.com/avatar/299a3d891ff1920b69c364d061007043?s=70)](https://twitter.com/jdalton "Follow @jdalton on Twitter") |\n|---|\n| [John-David Dalton](http://allyoucanleet.com/) |\n\n## License\n\nPunycode.js is available under the [MIT](https://mths.be/mit) license.\n',
